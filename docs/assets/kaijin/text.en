Around that time, town after town, house after house, all over Tokyo, when two or more people met each other, it was like greeting the weather.

was rumored.
"
twenty faces
”
That's the nickname of the mysterious thief who makes headlines in the newspapers every day.
The thief was said to have twenty very different faces.
In other words, they are exceptionally good at disguise.
In the brightest light, no matter how close you look at it, you can't tell it's a disguise, it looks like a completely different person.
It is said that you can become an old man or a young man, a rich man or a beggar, a scholar or a rogue, or even a woman.
So how old is the thief and what does he look like? No one has ever seen him.
I have twenty different faces, but no one knows which one is my true face.
No, even the thief himself may have forgotten his true face.
That is why he always appears in front of people with a different face and a different appearance.
He was a thief with such a genius of disguise, so even the police got into trouble.
After all, I have no idea which face to search for.
However, the good news is that this thief only steals beautiful, rare, and very expensive items such as jewelry and works of art. I have never acted disrespectfully to hurt or kill.
I hate blood.
However, no matter how much I dislike blood, since I am a person who does bad things, I do not know what I will do to escape from danger if my body becomes dangerous.

”
It's because I'm really scared and can't help but gossip.
In particular, wealthy people who had many valuable items in Japan were trembling and frightened.
From what I've seen so far, no matter how much I ask the police, I can't help but be a terrifying thief.
this

had one peculiar habit.
If you are aiming for something very precious, you should always send a notice in advance, saying that you will come to pick it up some day.
Even though he is a thief, he may be trying not to fight unfairly.
Or maybe I just want to dust myself off because no matter how careful I am, I'll get it right.
In any case, I must say that he is a fearless and outrageous phantom thief.
This story is the story of a one-on-one battle between such a haunting, supernatural thief and Kogoro Akechi, Japan's greatest detective, where power and power, wisdom and wisdom, and sparks fly.
The great detective Kogoro Akechi has a boy assistant named Yoshio Kobayashi.
The squirrel-like activity of this lovely little detective is also a sight to behold.
Now, with that out of the way, let's get down to the story.
In Aru Yashiki Town in Azabu, there is a large mansion that is 100 meters square.
A high concrete wall, which seems to be about 4 meters high, stretches out into the distance.
When you enter through the imposing iron door, you will see a large cycad planted in abundance, and beyond the dense foliage you can see the fine entrance.
A wide Japanese-style building and a large two-story Western-style building with yellow decorative bricks are lined up side by side, and behind them is a wide and beautiful garden like a park. There is.
This is the residence of business mogul Sotaro Hashiba.
The Hashiba family was now being overwhelmed by a mixture of great joy and great fear.
My joy was that my eldest son, Souichi, who ran away from home ten years ago, came back to Japan from the island of Borneo in the South Seas to apologize to his father.
Soichi was born to be an adventurous child. After graduating from junior high school, he and his schoolmates traveled to a new world in the South Seas and hoped to start some exciting business. I didn't give up, so I ran out of my house in vain, boarded a small sailing ship, and sailed across the South Seas.
For the next ten years, Souichi-kun didn't help me at all, and I didn't even know where I was going. , he said he wanted to go home to apologize to his father.
Mr. Soichi now has a large rubber plantation near Sandakan, and the letter included a photograph of the rubber plantation and a recent photograph of Mr. Soichi.
I am thirty years old.
He had grown into a fine man with a mustache under his nose.
My father, my mother, my younger sister Sanae, and my younger brother Soji, who is still in elementary school, were overjoyed.
I can't wait to get off the ship at Shimonoseki and fly home.
On the other hand, it was none other than the great fear that haunted the Hashiba family.
"
twenty faces
"
This is a scary notice.
The text of the notice is
"
You know what kind of person I am from the newspapers.
I am certain that you will treasure the six large diamonds that once adorned the crown of the Romanov royal family as family heirlooms.
This time, I have decided to hand over the six diamonds on the right to you free of charge.
I plan to visit him in the near future.
We will notify you of the exact date and time.
Please be very careful.
"
So in conclusion
"
twenty faces

was signed.
After the fall of the Russian tsarist regime, a white Russian man obtained a coronet from the old Romanov family, removed only the jewel from the decoration, and sold it to a Chinese merchant. It was bought by Mr. Hashiba of Japan, and it was a precious treasure with a price of two million yen.
The six jewels are actually stored in the safe in Mr. Soutarou's study, and it seems that the Phantom Thief knows exactly where they are.
Upon receiving the notice, Mr. Sotaro, the master, did not change his complexion, but his wife, the daughter, and even the servants were trembling.
In particular, the manager of the Hashiba family, the old man Kondo, was frustrated by the fact that it was a big deal for his master, and he turned himself in to the police and asked for protection, bought a new, fierce dog, and tried all sorts of other ways to prevent thieves. I prepared for the attack.
A family of police officers lived in the neighborhood of the Hashiba family. I tried to get the police to do their best.
In addition, Mr. Sotaro has three secretaries.
A policeman, a secretary, a fierce dog, and how much
"
twenty faces
”
It would be unthinkable for even a monster thief to sneak in.
Even so, what awaited him was the return of his eldest son, Souichi.
He's such a good boy that he went to an island in the South Seas, empty-handed, and achieved today's success.
Well, it happened early in the morning on the day Souichi arrived at Haneda Airport.
A boy emerged from the storehouse of the Hashiba family, where the autumn morning sun was shining brightly.
This is Souji, an elementary school student.
It was early in the morning before breakfast was ready, so the house was quiet.
Only sparrows, which are early risers, are chirping on the branches of garden trees and on the roofs of earthen storehouses.
That early morning, Soji came down the stone steps of the earthen storehouse into the garden, wearing a towel and sleeping, and carrying in both hands what looked like a terrifying piece of iron equipment.
What happened?
Sparrows weren't the only ones who were surprised.
Last night, Souji had a terrifying dream.
"
twenty faces
”
A thief sneaked into the study on the second floor of a Western-style building from somewhere and stole treasure.
The thief had a pale, expressionless face, like a Noh mask hanging in his father's living room.
When he stole the treasure, he suddenly opened the second-floor window and jumped out into the pitch-black garden.
"
Wow.
”
Fortunately, it was a dream.
However, I can't help but feel that the same thing as in my dream is about to happen.
"
The guy with twenty faces must be jumping out of that window.
And they must escape across the garden.
"
Soji-kun believed in such a way.
"
There is a flowerbed under that window.
The flowerbeds will be rumbled.
"
As he fantasized, a strange thought popped into Souji's head.
"
Un, yes.
This is a good idea.
Let's set a trap in that flower bed.
If things were to happen as I imagined, the thieves would surely cross that flower bed.
If you set a trap there, the thief may be successful.
”
The trap that Soji came up with was last year, I think, when a friend of your father who ran a forestry business wanted to have him make an iron trap, so he brought an American-made sample. It was because I remembered well that it was stored in the storehouse as it was.
Souji became irritated by the idea.
It is doubtful whether a thief would fall for a trap set in a large garden, but there is no reason to think about such a thing.
I just wanted to try to set a trap.
So I woke up unusually early, sneaked into the storehouse, and brought out a large iron tool.
Soji remembered the thrilling and pleasant feeling he once had when he caught a mouse.
But this time, the opponent is not a rat, but a human.
Moreover
"
twenty faces
"
It is a rare thief.
The excitement was ten or twenty times greater than that of a mouse.
After carrying the iron trap to the middle of the flower bed, I opened the two frames with large saws with all my strength and set them in place. Did.
If a thief stepped into it, just like a rat trap, the two saws would instantly snap and bite into the thief's neck like the teeth of a huge black beast. I put it away.
It would be a shame if the householder got caught in the trap, but it's in the middle of the flower bed, and unless you're a thief, it's rare for anyone to trespass into such a place.
"
That's all right.
But I hope it works.
It would be so nice if a thief got his ankle caught in this thing and couldn't move.
I hope it goes well.
"
Souji dressed as if he was praying to the gods, and then, grinning, he went into the house.
It was a very childish idea.
But a boy's intuition can never be taken lightly.
I would like the readers to keep this trap in mind as to what kind of important role the trap set by Soji-kun will play in the future.
That afternoon, the entire Hashiba family mobilized to meet Soichi at Haneda Airport when he returned home.
When Souichi got off the plane, he looked as good as I had expected.
With a thin dark brown coat on the side and a double-buttoned suit of the same color, the trousers with straight folds looked long and smooth, and I felt like a Westerner in a movie. .
Beneath the same dark brown fedora was smiling a beautiful face, a sunburnt copper-colour not much different from the hat.
The thick eyebrows, the bright eyes, the bright white teeth that appeared every time he smiled, and the thin mustache on his upper lip made him feel nostalgic.
It looks just like the photo.
No, it was much better than the photo.
After shaking hands with everyone, Souichi got into the car, sandwiched between his father and mother.
Soji, along with his older sister and old man Kondo, were in the other car. Somehow, it seemed that happiness welled up.
By the time we got home and everyone was talking to Souichi, it was already evening.
In the dining room, a supper was prepared with the kindness of the mother.
A large table covered with a new tablecloth was covered with beautiful autumn flowers, and silver knives and forks glittered at each table.
Today, unlike usual, there was a properly folded napkin.
During the meal, Souichi was the center of conversation.
Rare South Sea stories were told one after another.
In the meantime, recollections of boyhood, before running away from home, also popped up.
"
Soji-kun, you were just starting to play footjob at that time, and you used to break into my study room and scrabble around on my desk.
Once I turned over an inkpot and rubbed my face with my hand, so I became like a black man and made a big fuss.
Hey mom.
”
My mother could not remember whether such a thing had happened, but she was just happy and nodded with tears in her eyes.
But, dear readers, the joy of these families was suddenly cut off by some terrible event, as if the strings of a violin were broken.
What a heartless devil!
It was a once-in-a-lifetime reunion between father and son, brothers and sisters.
In the midst of our reminiscences, my secretary brought in a telegram.
No matter how much we were talking, I had to open the telegram and take a look.
Mr. Sotaro read the telegram with a slight frown, but then, for some reason, he suddenly fell into silence.
"
Father, do you have any concerns?
”
Souichi-kun spotted it quickly and asked.
"
Hmmm, something troubling jumped in.
I don't want to make you guys worry, but if something like this is coming, I'll have to be very careful tonight.
”
By the way, in the telegram you showed me,
"
Konyasho 12
”
It was.
Twenty means
"
twenty faces
”
must be an abbreviation for
"
Shoichi Niji
"
is a sentence full of conviction that it will be stolen at exactly midnight.
"
Doesn't this 20 mean the thief with 20 faces?
"
Souichi was taken aback and looked at his father.
"
that's right.
I know you very well.
”
"
Since landing in Shimonoseki, I have often heard rumors about it.
I also read newspapers on the plane.
Finally, you aimed at me.
But what does he want?
”
"
Since you left me, I have acquired the diamond that once decorated the crown of the former Russian emperor.
The thief will steal it.
”
Sotaro said,
"
twenty faces
"
I told them in detail about the bandits and their notices.
"
But tonight you'll be with me, so I'm fine.
One, I wonder if you and I will stay awake in front of the jewel.
”
"
Yes, that would be fine.
I have confidence in my strength.
I would be happy if I could help you go home.
”
In an instant, the house was heavily guarded.
At 8:00 p.m., the front gate and all the other entrances and exits were tightly closed and locked from the inside.
"
Just for tonight, I'll say goodbye to any customer.
”
The old man sternly ordered his servants.
All through the night, three off-duty policemen, three secretaries, and a motorist were to split up and secure each doorway or patrol the house.
Mrs. Hashiba, Mr. Sanae, and Mr. Soji were ordered to withdraw into their bedroom early on.
A large group of servants gathered in one room, whispering frightenedly to each other.
Mr. Sotaro and Mr. Souichi decided to besiege themselves in the study on the second floor of the Western-style building.
Sandwiches and wine are laid out on the table in the study for an all-nighter.
All the doors and windows of the study were locked or latched so that the outside could not be seen.
There really is no gap between the ants.
Now, when I sat down in the study, Mr. Sotaro said with a wry smile.
"
I may have been a little too cautious.
”
"
No, no precautions can be overstated with him.
I've been researching the case of "Twenty Faces" in newspapers for some time now, and the more I read about it, the more frightening it became.
”
Souichi-kun answered with a serious face and a sense of unease.
"
Then, do you think that even with such a strong defense, thieves may still come?
”
"
Yes, it seems like I'm timid, but somehow I feel like that.
”
"
But from where?
In order for the thieves to obtain the jewels, they must first climb over a high wall.
Then you have to swipe the eyes of a lot of people and knock down the door, even if you've made it this far.
And we must fight against each other.
And it doesn't stop there.
The jewels are in a vault that cannot be opened without knowing the combination of letters on the dial.
Even if Twenty Faces is a wizard, how can he pass through these four and five barriers?
Hahaha…….
”
Sotaro laughed out loud.
But there was something empty and taunting in that laughter.
"
But, Dad, from what I see in the newspapers, he's done so many times with such ease that it seems impossible.
In some cases, when you are relieved that things are safe because they are in a safe, there is a large hole in the back of the safe, and all the items inside are gone.
There is also the case of five good-looking men who, while watching, were forced to take sleeping pills before they knew it, and all fell asleep soundly.
He has the wisdom to come up with any means, depending on the time and circumstances.
”
"
Oi oi Souichi, you sound like you're praising a thief.
”
Mr. Sotaro looked at his child in astonishment.
"
No, it's not praise.
But the more I study him, the more frightening he becomes.
His weapon is not physical strength.
Wisdom.
Depending on how you use your wisdom, there is almost nothing you cannot do in this world.
”
While the father and son were discussing such things, the night was slowly sinking in, and the wind seemed to pick up a little, and the black wind that blew too quickly made the windows rattle.
"
No, I'm starting to get a little worried because you're so into buying thieves.
Let's check one gem.
It would be a big problem if there was a hole in the back of the safe.
”
Mr. Sotaro laughed and got to his feet, approached a small safe in the corner of the room, turned the dial, opened the door, and took out a small red copper box.
Then, holding the small box in his arms, he returned to his original chair and placed it on the round table between him and Souichi.
"
I am seeing it for the first time.
”
Souichi-kun seemed to be curious about the jewel in question, and said, keeping an eye out.
"
Hmm, it was the first time for you.
Now, this is the diamond that once shone in the head of the Russian emperor.
”
When the lid of the casket was opened, a dazzling rainbow of colors flashed.
Six very fine diamonds, the size of soybeans, shone on black velvet pedestals.
After Souichi-kun had had enough of it, the lid of the small box was closed.
"
Let's leave this box here.
Rather than a safe, I'd rather you and I stare at each other with four eyes.
”
"
yeah, that would be better.
"
The two of them had no more words to talk to each other.
Sometimes, as I recall, the wind blew too far, rattling the panes of the windows.
Somewhere in the distance, you hear a dog barking loudly.
"
what time is it
”
"
It's eleven forty-three.
Seventeen minutes later...
”
When Souichi looked at his wristwatch and answered, the two of them fell silent again.
When I looked at him, even Mr. Sotaro's bold face turned pale, and his forehead was dripping with sweat.
Souichi also has his fist on his lap and clenched his teeth.
The room was so quiet that you could hear their breathing and the ticking of their watches.
"
How long is it?
”
"
Enough more.
”
Just then, out of the corner of their eyes, they caught sight of something small and white, trickling across the carpet.
Oh my gosh, I wonder if it's a mouse.
Mr. Sotaro was startled and looked under the desk behind him.
The white thing seemed to be hidden under the desk.
"
Hey, isn't that a ping-pong ball?
But how did something like this come about?
"
I picked it up from under the desk and looked at it curiously.
"
It's funny.
Soji-kun had left the item on the shelf nearby, and it must have fallen off due to some kind of momentum.
"
"
Might be so…….
But what time?
”
The number of times he asks Mr. Sotaro about the time becomes more and more frequent.
"
Four minutes left.
”
They looked at each other eye to eye.
The sound of ticking seconds seemed frightening.
3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, and the time draws near.
Twenty Faces may have climbed over the wall by now.
You may be walking down the hallway by now...
No, you may already be outside the door and listening.
Oh, at any moment, with a terrible noise, the door will be broken down.
"
Father, what have you done?
"
"
No, no, nothing.
I won't lose to something like Twenty Faces.
”
Despite that, Mr. Soutarou was already straight and was holding his forehead with both hands.
Thirty seconds, twenty seconds, ten seconds, the heartbeats of the two of them synchronizing, a terrifying second that seemed to hold their breath.
"
Hey, what time?
”
A groaning voice from Mr. Sotaro asks.
"
It's one past twelve.
”
"
What, was it a minute too long?
…… Ahahaha …… How about it, Souichi, the Twenty Faces notice is also unreliable, isn’t it?
The gems are right here.
There's nothing wrong.
”
Mr. Sotaro laughed out loud in triumph.
But Souichi didn't even smile.
"
I can't believe it.
Are there any abnormalities in jewels?
Is Twenty Faces a man who breaks a contract?
”
"
what are you talking about
The jewel is right in front of you.
”
"
But it's a box.
”
"
Then you have only the box and what's wrong with the diamonds inside?
”
"
I want to make sure.
I can't be sure until I find out.
”
Mr. Sotaro instinctively stood up and held the small copper box with both hands.
Souichi also stood up.
Their eyes stood still in a strange glare for almost a minute.
"
Let's open it up.
It can't be that stupid.
”
With a snap, the lid of the small box was opened.
And at the same time, from Mr. Sotaro's mouth,
"
Oh.
”
A cry erupted.
No.
It is completely empty on the black velvet plinth.
The 2,000,000-yen diamond with a long history had disappeared as if it had evaporated.
For a while, the two of them remained silent, just looking at each other with pale faces, until finally Mr. Sotaro said,
"
It's a wonder.
”
and muttered.
"
It's a wonder.
”
Souichi also muttered the same thing to the parrot.
Strangely enough, however, Souichi didn't seem to be surprised or worried at all.
You can even see the shadow of a smile on the corner of his lips.
"
There's nothing wrong with the door opening, and if anyone were to come in, it's possible that I wouldn't be able to see it.
I don't think the thief would have slipped in through the keyhole of the door like a ghost.
”
"
That's right, but no matter how many faces you have, you can't turn into a ghost.
"
"
Then there was no one else in this room who could touch a diamond but me and you.
”
Mr. Soutarou stared at his child's face with a somewhat obscene expression.
"
that's right.
There is no one but you or me.
”
Soichi's smirk gradually became clearer and he began to smile.
"
Hey, Souichi, what are you laughing at?
What's wrong?
”
Mr. Sotaro suddenly changed his complexion and shouted.
"
I admire the thieves' demeanor.
He's great after all.
You kept your promise, didn't you?
Didn't you break through ten or twenty layers of vigilance?
”
"
Come on, Yosanka.
You are praising the thief again.
In other words, are you saying that my face is strange because I was outwitted by a thief?
"
"
That's right.
It's really funny to see you so confused.
"
Oh, is this the word to the father of the son?
Mr. Sotaro was taken aback rather than offended.
And now, the young man who was grinning in front of me was not my son, but a stranger.
"
Soichi, don't move there.
"
Mr. Sotaro, glaring at his son with a frightened face, tried to approach one wall of the room to call Rin.
"
Mr. Hashiba, you must not move.
”
To my surprise, the child called him Mr. Hashiba.
Then he took a small pistol out of his pocket, put his hand to his armpit, and aimed it at his father.
The face is still grinning.
When Mr. Sotaro saw the pistol, he froze and couldn't move.
"
Do not call people.
Raise your voice and I'll pull the trigger.
”
"
Who the hell are you?
Maybe....
”
"
Hahaha...it looks like you've finally figured it out.
Rest assured.
I am not your son Souichi.
As you can guess, the thief you call Twenty Faces.
"
Mr. Sotaro stared at the other person's face as if he were a ghost.
Because there was a mystery that could not be solved.
Then who wrote that letter from Borneo?
Whose photo is that?
"
Hahaha... Twenty Faces is a wizard in fairy tales.
I will do what no one else can do.
Mr. Hashiba, as a thank you for giving me the diamond, let me explain.
"
The mysterious young man calmly explained as if he did not know the danger to himself.
"
I found out that Souichi-kun's whereabouts were unknown.
I also got a picture of him before he left home.
I imagined what kind of face Souichi-kun would change into over the course of ten years, and I created this face.
”
He said and slapped himself on the cheek.
"
So that photo is none other than this photo of me.
I also wrote the letter.
Then I sent the letter and the photo to a friend of mine in Borneo and had him mail it to you.
I'm sorry, but Souichi's whereabouts are still unknown.
They do not heal on the island of Borneo.
It's all about this Twenty Faces play from beginning to end.
”
The people of the Hashiba family, both father and mother, were overwhelmed with joy at the return of their beloved eldest son, and had no idea that such a terrifying mechanism would exist.
"
I am a ninjutsu user.
”
The Twenty Faces, too, went on, seemingly very special.
"
Do you understand.
Hey, it's the ping-pong ball from earlier.
That is the seed of ninjutsu.
I threw it out of my pocket onto the carpet.
You were preoccupied with the ball for a while.
I looked under the desk.
It was a no-brainer to take out the diamond from the jewelry box at that time.
Hahaha......, goodbye.
"
Holding his pistol, the thief stepped back, turned the key left in the keyhole with his left hand, flung open the door, and ran out into the hallway.
The corridor has windows overlooking the garden.
The thief unfastened the latch, opened the glass door, and slid across the window frame.
"
Please give this to Souji as a toy.
I don't kill people.
”
Saying so, he threw the pistol into the room and disappeared.
I jumped down from the second floor into the garden.
Mr. Sotaro was once again outmaneuvered.
The pistol was a toy.
At first, I was too frightened by the toy pistol to call anyone.
But you, dear readers, will remember.
The thief's jumping window is the window that the young boy Soji saw in his dream.
Beneath that, the iron trap that Souji had set should have a mouth like a saw, waiting for prey.
The dream was a true dream.
Then, perhaps that trap will also be of some use.
Oh maybe!
Seeing the thief throwing out his pistol and jumping outside, Mr. Sotaro immediately rushed to the window and looked down into the dark garden.
Even though it's dark, the garden is lit up with electric lights, like the night lights in the park, so it's not so dark that people can't be seen.
The thief appeared to have been knocked down by the jumping rain, but immediately jumped up and started running with great force.
However, as expected, he jumped into the flower bed.
Then, just as he ran a few steps through the flower bed, there was a loud metallic clang, and the black shadow of the thief fell with a thud.
"
is there anyone
A thief.
A thief.
Go to the garden.
”
Mr. Sotaro shouted loudly.
Had it not been for the trap, the swift thief would have escaped long ago.
Souji's childlike idea paid off.
While the thief was struggling to get out of the trap, people rushed to him from all sides.
There were seven officers in uniform, secretaries, and a driver.
Mr. Sotaro also hurried down the stairs and, together with old man Kondo, turned a light into the garden from the downstairs window and helped with the catch.
The only thing that seemed odd was that John, the ferocious dog he had bought with so much effort, hadn't shown up in the turmoil.
If John had helped him, he would never have let the thief escape.
When Twenty Faces finally got out of the trap and got up, his pursuers with flashlights in their hands were already ten meters away.
Not from one side, but from the right, from the left, and from the front.
The thief ran like a black wind.
No, it might be better to say it like a bullet.
I broke through one side of the circle of pursuers and ran into the back of the garden.
The garden is big like a park.
There is an artificial hill, a pond, and a forest-like grove.
Darkness is dark, and seven pursuers are never enough.
Oh, if only John was here at a time like this...
But the pursuers were desperate.
The three police officers in particular are skilled people when it comes to fishing.
When he saw that the thief had run up into the bushes on top of the artificial hill, he ran across the flat ground and made a round ahead of him on the other side of the artificial hill.
I'm trying to make it a scissors house with the pursuers later.
If you do this, the thieves will not be able to escape outside the fence.
Besides, the concrete wall that surrounded the garden was four meters high, and there was no way to get over it without a ladder.
"
Ah, here it is, the thief is here.
"
One of the secretaries cried amidst the bushes on top of the hill.
The round light of the flashlight is focused there from all sides.
The bushes were as bright as day.
In the light, the thief curls his back and descends like a ball to the forest-like grove on the right side of the artificial hill.
"
Don't let me escape, I'm down the mountain.
”
Then, the flashlight runs beautifully through the grove of large trees.
Because the garden is so large, with so many trees and rocks, and because the thieves are so skillful at escaping, it is impossible to catch them while looking at their backs.
In the meantime, a number of police officers from a nearby police station rushed in on an urgent phone call and immediately secured the outside of the fence.
The thief is finally a mouse in a bag.
In the mansion, the hideous game of tag continued for some time, until the pursuers suddenly lost sight of the thief.
The thief was running right in front of him.
It flickered in and out, like weaving through the trunk of a large tree.
All of a sudden it disappeared.
I looked at the trees one by one, all the way to the top of the branches, but there was no sign of the thief anywhere.
There are police guards outside the fence.
As for the building, not only the Western-style building, but also the Japanese-style tatami room has shutters, and the electric lights throughout the house illuminate the garden brightly. I'm out on the side looking at the catch in the garden, so I can't run away there.
The thief must be hiding somewhere in the garden.
And yet, no matter how much the seven people searched, they could not find it.
It seems that Twenty Faces used ninjutsu again.
In the end, I decided that I had no choice but to wait until dawn and search again.
As long as the front gate, the back gate, and the outside of the fence are well-checked, the thieves are rats in the bag, so it would be all right to wait until morning.
The pursuers pulled up the garden to help the police outside the mansion, but only one car driver, Matsuno, was still in the back of the garden.
Surrounded by trees like a forest, there is a large pond.
Driver Matsuno was walking along the bank of the pond, belated by the people, when he suddenly noticed something.
The flashlight illuminated the pool of fallen leaves, and among the fallen leaves was a piece of bamboo sticking its head out slightly and swaying.
It's not because of the wind.
Even though there were no waves, only the pieces of bamboo were trembling.
A very strange idea popped into Matsuno's head.
I thought I should call everyone back.
But I'm not so sure.
It's hard to believe.
He squatted on the bank of the pond with the light still on.
Then, in order to break the dreaded quarrel, he began to do strange things.
He felt in his pocket, took out a piece of nose paper, tore it into thin strips, and slipped it onto a piece of bamboo in the pond.
Then something strange happened.
At the tip of the bamboo tube, a thin piece of paper began to move up and down.
For the paper to move like that, there must be air moving in and out of the bamboo tube.
Matsuno couldn't bring himself to believe his imagination.
But what should we do with this sure thing?
A piece of lifeless bamboo shouldn't be able to breathe.
In winter, it's just unthinkable.
But, as I said before, it's autumn, October, and the weather isn't that cold.
The monster with twenty faces, in particular, is so adventurous that it calls itself a magician.
At that time, Matsuno should have called everyone.
But he probably wanted to keep his hands to himself.
I thought I would try to dispel that suspicion without relying on the power of others.
When he put the lamp down on the ground, he suddenly reached out with both hands, grabbed a piece of bamboo, and pulled it up.
The strip of bamboo was about thirty centimeters long.
Perhaps Soji was playing in the garden and left it there.
When I pulled it, the bamboo stretched smoothly.
But it wasn't just bamboo.
At the end of the bamboo was a human hand, black with the mud of the pond, clinging to it.
No, it's not all about hands.
At the end of his hand, a soaking-wet figure like a umibōzu suddenly appeared.
And what happened on the shore of the pond, I'll leave it to the reader's imagination for a while.
Five or six minutes later, the former Matsuno driver was standing on the same bank of the pond as if nothing had happened.
It seems a little hard to breathe.
I can't see anything else that has changed.
He hurriedly began to walk towards the main house.
What happened?
I am a little lame.
However, while limping, he steadily crossed the garden and came to the front gate.
At the front gate, two secretaries wield something like wooden swords and watch them carefully.
When Matsuno went to the front, he put his hand on his forehead and said,
"
I can't help but feel cold.
You seem to have a fever.
Let me rest for a while.
"
said in a weak voice.
"
Ah, Matsuno-kun, it's okay, take a rest.
Because we are the ones here.
”
One of the secretaries answered cheerfully.
Driver Matsuno said hello and disappeared into the garage by the entrance.
His room is in the back of the garage.
The rest of the day passed without a hitch.
No one has passed through the front gate or the back gate.
Even the police officers who were watching outside the fence did not see anyone who looked like a thief.
At 7 o'clock, a large number of police officers from the Metropolitan Police Department came and began investigating the mansion.
Until the investigation was over, the family was forbidden to leave the house, but the students had no choice.
Sanae, a third-year student at Kadowaki Junior High School, and Souji, a fifth-year student at Takachiho Elementary School, left Yashiki by car as usual.
The driver still didn't seem to be in good spirits, didn't speak much, and had his head down all the time.
First, Chief Investigator Nakamura of the Metropolitan Police Department met with his husband, Mr. Sotaro, in the study at the crime scene, listened to the facts of the case in detail, and after taking a general look at the people in the residence, began searching the garden. I started.
"
From the time we arrived last night until now, not a single person has left the Yashiki.
None climbed over the fence.
I hope you can trust me on this point.
”
The Chief Detective of the local police station asserted to Chief Nakamura.
"
Then the thief is still hiding in the mansion.
”
"
that's right.
I can only think so.
However, I have started searching since dawn this morning, but so far nothing has been found.
Except for the dog's death...
”
"
Eh, the dog's death?
”
"
We had a dog named John in our house to guard against thieves, but it died of poison last night.
Upon further investigation, I discovered that the guy with twenty faces who had disguised himself as the son of this place had been out in the garden the previous evening and was feeding the dog.
It's a very well-prepared method.
If this little boy hadn't set a trap for him, he would have easily escaped.
”
"
Let's explore the garden again.
It's a very large garden, so there may be some kind of hidden place.
”
While the two were standing talking like that, they heard a loud cry from beyond the artificial hill in the garden.
"
please come here
discovered.
I found a thief.
"
Along with that cry came the rushing sound of footsteps from all over the garden.
Cops rush to the scene.
Chief Nakamura and the chief detective also started running to hear the voice.
When I went there, the voice was one of Mr. Hashiba's secretaries.
He is standing under a large shii tree in a forest-like grove, pointing upwards.
"
That's it.
The one over there is certainly a thief.
There are memories in clothes.
”
The shii tree is forked at a point about three meters from its roots. I was lying around.
Seeing that he didn't even try to run away despite the noise, I wondered if the thief had died.
Or are you losing your mind?
I don't think he's dozing off in a tree.
"
Someone please pull him out.
”
At the command of the chief of staff, a ladder was immediately carried, and with the help of three or four people, some climbing it and others holding it from below, the thieves were brought down to the ground.
"
Hey, aren't you tied up?
”
It's like a thin silk string, and it's wrapped around and around.
Besides, it's a gag.
I put a large handkerchief in my mouth and tied it tightly with another handkerchief.
Then, strangely enough, my clothes were soaking wet, as if they had been in the rain.
As soon as I took the gag, the man seemed to cheer himself up.
"
Damn it, damn it.
”
groaned.
"
Ah, you're Matsuno-kun, aren't you?
"
The secretary cried out in surprise.
It wasn't Twenty Faces.
She was wearing a Twenty Faces outfit, but her face was completely different.
It must be Matsuno, the chauffeur.
But speaking of the driver, he probably just left to take Sanae and Souji to school.
Why is Matsuno here?
"
What happened to you?
”
When asked by the chief, Matsuno said,
"
Damn it, I got hit.
I was beaten by him.
”
cried frustratedly.
According to Matsuno's words, the thief successfully blinded his pursuers by the following extraordinary means, and escaped easily in front of a large crowd.
While being chased by the people, the thief jumped into the garden pond and sank into the water.
But I couldn't breathe because I was just burrowing under the water, but there was a piece of bamboo without knots that Souji had discarded as a toy, so I took it into the pond. I crawled in, put a bamboo tube to my mouth, put one chopstick out of the water, breathed quietly, and waited for my pursuers to stand up.
However, Matsuno, who remained behind the people and looked around the area by himself, discovered the piece of bamboo and realized the plot of the thief.
When I dared to pull out the piece of bamboo, a man covered in mud appeared from the pond.
Thereupon, a fight in the darkness began, but Matsuno, who was ill-tempered, did not even have time to ask for help. I was raped and gagged.
Then they changed their clothes and carried them to the top of a tall tree.
When I realized that, the driver who took Souji and the others to school was finally decided to be a fake.
An important young lady has gone somewhere in a car driven by Twenty Faces herself.
People's astonishment, father's and mother's worries, need no explanation.
First, a phone call was made to Kadowaki Junior High School, where Sanae was going.
Then, unexpectedly, I found out that Sanae-san was suddenly on the way to school.
Then, I was relieved that the thief didn't intend to kidnap me, so I called Soji's school and asked him. The answer is that I can't see you two.
Hearing that, my father and mother's complexion changed.
The thief may have learned that it was Souji who set the trap.
And he may have invited only Souji to heal the wound on his leg.
Come on, it's a big fuss.
Chief Investigator Nakamura immediately reported this to the Metropolitan Police Department and made arrangements to find the Hashiba family's car by cordoning all over Tokyo.
Luckily, I know the make and number of the car, so I have enough clues.
Almost every 30 minutes, Mr. Sotaro called the school and the Metropolitan Police Department to inquire about the situation after that, but one hour, two hours, three hours, time went by without hesitation. For a long time, I had no idea of ​​Souji's whereabouts.
However, just after noon that day, a young man in a dirty suit and bird's hat appeared at the entrance of the Hashiba family and said something strange.
"
I was asked by an otaku driver.
The driver had some personal business on the way, so he asked me to bring the car.
I've put the car in the gate, so I'd like you to check it out and receive it.
”
The secretary reports it to the back.
So, the owner, Sotaro, and the manager, the old man Kondo, rushed to the front door and checked the car, and found that it was indeed the Hashiba family's car.
But there is no one inside.
After all, Souji was invited.
"
Oh, there's an envelope that looks like this.
”
Old Kondo picked up a sealed letter from the cushion of the car.
in that table
"
Sotaro Hashiba's personal exhibition
”
It's just written big, and even if you look at the back, there's no sender's name.
"
I wonder what.
"
Then Mr. Sotaro opened the seal and read it while standing in the garden.
You did give me six diamonds last night.
Take it home and keep it as a precious jewel or family heirloom.
However, as gratitude is gratitude, there is a little resentment.
Someone had set a trap in the garden and wounded my leg in ten days.
I am entitled to compensation for damages.
For that reason, I brought back my son Souji as a hostage.
Souji is now locked up in the cold basement of my house, crying bitterly in the dark.
Soji-kun is the one who set the damned trap.
Isn't it natural to be so lazy?
By the way, as for compensation for the damage, I will demand the Kanzeon statue that you have.
I had the privilege of visiting your fine arts room yesterday, and I was astonished at its splendor.
Among them, that statue of Kanzeon was carved in the Kamakura period, and there was a description that it was made by Anami, but I really wanted it to be a national treasure.
At that time, I firmly resolved that I must give you this Buddha statue no matter what.
Tonight, at ten o'clock, three of my subordinates will be visiting your house, so I'd like you to quietly let them through to the art room.
They are planning to pack only the statue of Kanzeon and bring it to the truck.
The hostage, Souji, asks you to return to your house in exchange for the Buddha statue.
The promise is unmistakable in the name of Twenty Faces.
Do not report this to the police.
Also, don't let them follow your subordinate's truck.
If that happens, please assume that Souji-kun will never return.
I believe that this proposal will be accepted without fail, but just to be sure, please keep the main gate open until 10 o'clock tonight.
I will visit you to mark it.
From Twenty Faces, Sotaro Hashiba, what a beastly request.
Mr. Soutarou and others clenched their fists and frustrated me, but I couldn't do anything if Souji, an irreplaceable hostage, was taken.
I'm sorry, but it seems that I have no choice but to accept this unreasonable offer.
By the way, I caught a young man who had driven a car at the request of the thief, and I thoroughly interrogated him.
As soon as the young driver had left, the owner, Mr. and Mrs. Sotaro, the old man Kondo, and Sanae-san, who had been sent by the school janitor and returned by skipping the car, joined us in a private room. I was consulted.
I can't wait any longer.
Speaking of ten o'clock, there are only eight or nine hours.
"
Anything else is fine.
You can get diamonds as long as you pay for them.
However, I really don't want to let go of that statue of Kanzeon.
I am sorry for the Japanese art world that such a national treasure as a masterpiece should be handed over to thieves.
That sculpture is in the art room of this house, but I don't think it's my personal property.
”
Mr. Sotaro was not thinking only about his own child.
However, Mrs. Hashiba is not like that.
I'm full of things about poor Souji.
"
But if you don't hand over the Buddha statue, you don't know what will happen to that child.
I believe that no matter how important a work of art is, it cannot replace human life.
Please don't tell the police about it, and do what the bandit says.
"
Behind my mother's eyelids, I could clearly see Souji crying alone in the dark basement.
I can't wait until ten o'clock tonight.
Even now, in exchange for the Buddha statue, I want Souji to come back as soon as possible.
"
It goes without saying that I will get Souji back, but the thought of not only having my diamonds stolen, but also handing over that irreplaceable piece of art to a thief makes me unbearably sad.
Mr. Kondo, is there some way?
”
"
That's right.
If the police were to be notified, the matter would quickly escalate, so I must keep the thief's letter out of the house until ten o'clock tonight.
But if you're a private detective...
”
The old man suddenly came up with an idea.
"
Hmm, there is such a thing as a private detective.
But I wonder if a private detective can handle this big case.
”
"
According to what I hear, there is one great detective in Tokyo.
"
Seeing the old man tilting his head, Sanae suddenly interrupted.
"
Father, it's detective Kogoro Akechi.
If he's that person, he's a great detective who's solved many cases that the police threw at him.
”
"
That's right, it was Kogoro Akechi.
It seems that he is a really great man, and the Twenty Faces is a good deal.
”
"
Hmm, I've heard that name before.
Well then, let's quietly call the detective and talk about one thing.
Experts may have better ideas than we can imagine.
”
In the end, it was decided to ask Kogoro Akechi to handle this case.
Immediately, old man Kondo looked up the phone book and called detective Akechi's house.
Then, I heard this reply in a childish voice from the other side of the phone.
"
Sensei is currently on a business trip overseas for a serious incident, so I don't know when he will return.
However, I have an assistant named Kobayashi who is acting as Professor's substitute, so if that person is okay with me, I would like to visit you right away.
"
"
Oh, I see.
But it's a very difficult case.
As for the assistant...
"
As Manager Kondo was hesitant, a cheerful voice came from the other side, as if to put a smile on his face.
"
Even though I'm an assistant, I'm as good as a teacher.
I think you can trust me enough.
Anyway, let's visit once.
”
"
Is that so.
Then, please let me know so that I can help you immediately.
However, I would like to inform you that it is very difficult for the other party to know that I requested the case.
It's about human life.
Please be very careful and ask secretly so that no one will find out.
”
"
Needless to say, I am well aware of this.
”
There was such a question and answer, and the famous detective Kobayashi was finally coming.
When the phone hung up and it seemed like ten minutes had passed, a lovely boy stood at the entrance of the Hashiba family and asked for directions.
When the secretary came out to intercede, the boy said,
"
I'm Souji's friend.
"
and introduced myself.
"
Mr. Soji is not here.
”
When I answered, the boy gave me a look of disappointment,
"
I thought that was probably the case.
Please let me see my father for a while.
I have a message from my father.
My name is Kobayashi.
”
I asked for a meeting.
When I heard about it from my secretary, Mr. Sotaro said that the name Kobayashi was familiar to him, so he let me go to the reception room anyway.
When Mr. Sotaro entered, there stood a boy of twelve or three years old, with cheeks as shiny as apples and big eyes.
"
Are you Mr. Hashiba, nice to meet you.
I'm Kobayashi from Akechi Detective Agency.
Thank you for calling me.
"
The boy rolled his eyes and spoke clearly.
"
Oh, are you Kobayashi-san's messenger?
It's a small incident.
I'd like you to come in person...
"
The boy raised his hand to stop Mr. Sotaro when he answered.
"
No, I am Yoshio Kobayashi.
I have no other helpers.
"
"
Hoho, are you the person?
"
Mr. Sotaro was surprised.
At the same time, I began to feel somewhat comfortable.
Is it true that such a small child is a great detective?
However, his facial expression and his way of speaking are quite unusual.
For one thing, I would like to consult with this child.
"
Was it you who said you were a skilled detective on the phone just now?
”
"
Yes, that's right.
Sensei has completely entrusted me with the incident in Rusu.
”
Boy is confident.
"
I heard that you just said that you are Souji's friend.
How did you know Souji's name?
"
"
You can't do detective work without knowing that much.
I've been looking through scrapbooks to find out about your family in a business magazine.
I heard on the phone that someone's life was at stake, so I imagined that either Sanae-san or Souji-kun had gone missing.
It seems that the imagination came true.
Also, isn't the Twenty-Faced Thief involved in this incident?
"
Kobayashi boy is really good at speaking.
Indeed, Mr. Sotaro was completely impressed that this child might really be a great detective.
Therefore, I decided to invite the old man Kondo to the drawing room and tell the boy the details of the incident together.
The boy listened intently, interspersing short questions at vital points, but when the story was over, he asked to see the statue of Kannon.
Mr. Sotaro guided me back to the drawing room after looking at the art room. did.
After a while, the boy opened his eyes wide, got on his knees, and said enthusiastically.
"
I have come up with a clever way of doing it.
If the opponent is a magician, I will also become a magician.
It is a very dangerous method.
But you can't put your hands up without taking risks.
I've done even more dangerous things before.
”
"
Whoa, that's fun.
But what kind of method is that?
”
"
That's right.
"
Kobayashi suddenly approached Mr. Sotaro and whispered something into his ear.
"
What about you?
”
Mr. Sotaro couldn't help but roll his eyes at the outrageous offer.
"
that's right.
If you think about it, it seems difficult, but for us, this method has been tested.
Last year, Sensei used this hand to brutally match the French phantom thief Arsène Lupin.
”
"
Is there any danger to Souji?
”
"
That's great.
If it's a petty thief, it's more dangerous, but I don't think someone with twenty faces would break his promise.
Souji said that he would return the statue in exchange for it, so I'm sure he'll be back here before danger arises.
If not, then there is another way.
It's great.
I am a child, but I never think unreasonably.
"
"
I'm sorry if I let you do such a dangerous thing while Akechi-san was away, and that there would be a lot of trouble.
"
"
Hahaha...you don't know how we live.
Being a detective is like being a police officer.
But nothing like this.
It's not a dangerous job.
All you have to do is turn a blind eye.
I won't back down anymore, even if there is no excuse.
Just carry out the plan.
”
Both Mr. Hashiba and old man Kondo were overwhelmed by the boy's energy.
After a long discussion, it was finally decided to implement Kobayashi's ideas.
Well, let's stop talking and move on to what happened that night.
At 10:00 p.m., keeping an appointment, three rude men from Twenty Faces' subordinates passed through the open gates of the Hashiba family.
The thieves scrutinized the secretary standing at the entrance,
"
I have come to receive the promised goods.
"
Leaving behind a line, he seemed to have been taught how to do it, and without hesitation he plunged steadily into the depths.
At the entrance of the art room, Mr. Sotaro and the old man Kondo were waiting for him, and they called out to one of the thieves.
"
I guess the promise is true.
The children must have been taken.
”
Then the thief replied gruffly.
"
Don't worry.
The children have already been brought to the gate.
But it's no use looking for it.
It's devised so that no matter how much you look for it, you won't know until you guys carry out your luggage.
I have to, because this place is dangerous.
”
Goodbye, the three went into the Dokadoka Art Room.
The room was built like an earthen storehouse, and under the dim electric lights, glass shelves like a museum surround the room.
Good-looking swords, armor, figurines, handbags, folding screens, hanging scrolls, etc., were lined up in rows, and in a corner stood a rectangular glass box about a meter and a half high. Inside, the Kanzeon statue in question is enshrined.
A pale black Kannon, about half the size of a real human, sits on a renge pedestal.
It must have originally been a dazzling golden figure, but now it was just a pale black, and the many folds of the robe she was wearing were worn out in places.
But, as one might expect from a master craftsman, his gentle and gentle face is almost ready to burst into laughter.
The three thieves did not look at the gentle appearance of the Buddha statue, and immediately went to work.
"
I can't wait.
It's a big rush.
"
One man unfolds a cloth-like object that is not too thin, and the other man takes the chopsticks and wraps around the outside of the glass box of the Buddha statue.
In no time, an unrecognizable bundle of cloth was completed.
"
Here you go.
If you lay it down, it will break.
All right, all right.
”
With an outrageous shout, the three guys carry the package out.
Mr. Sotaro and old man Kondo sat close to the three of them and watched until it was loaded onto the truck.
Because if only the Buddha statue is taken away and Souji doesn't come back, nothing will come of it.
Before long, the truck's engine began to roar, and the car was about to leave.
"
Hey, where is Soji-san?
I won't let this car leave until I get Souji back.
If you leave unnecessarily, I will inform the police immediately.
”
Old Kondo was already working hard for the rest of his life.
"
Don't worry.
Look behind you.
Boy, come to the front door now.
"
When I turned around, I saw two black shadows, one big and one small, in front of the entrance light.
While Mr. Sotaro and the old man were preoccupied with it,
"
Bye…….
"
The truck left the gate and became smaller and smaller.
The two of them hurried back to the shadow of the entrance.
"
Oh, aren't these the father and son beggars who were at the gate a while ago?
Well, I wonder if I was eaten a lot.
"
They were two beggars who looked like father and son.
Both of them are dressed in ragged and dirty clothes, and have damp towels on their cheeks.
"
what are you guys
Don't you want to come to a place like this?
"
When old Kondo scolded him, the beggar parent burst into laughter.
"
Ehehehehehe, I promise you.
”
Just when I thought I said something incomprehensible, he suddenly started running.
Like the wind, it flew out of the gate through the darkness.
"
Father, it's me.
"
Now the child beggar says something strange.
Then, suddenly, he took off his cheeks and took off his ragged kimono, and what appeared from underneath was a familiar school uniform and a white face.
The child beggar was none other than Souji.
"
What's wrong with you?
”
Mr. Hashiba asked, holding the hands of the nostalgic Souji.
"
Is there some reason?
The guy with twenty faces dressed me in this kind of kimono.
But until now, I had been gagged and could not speak.
”
Ah, so the current pro-beggar was Twenty Faces himself.
He must have disguised himself as a beggar, and after seeing that the Buddha statue was being carried out, he must have returned Souji as promised and fled.
But what a fancy disguise to be a beggar!
A beggar who hangs around in front of people's gates would not be taken aback.
Souji-kun has returned home.
When I asked about it, they told me that although they were confined in the basement, they were not particularly abused and were given plenty of food.
With this, the Hashiba family's big worries were removed.
I'll leave it up to you, the reader, to imagine what the father and mother's joy was like.
On the other hand, Twenty Faces, disguised as a beggar, flew out like the wind from the gate of the Hashiba House, hid in a dark side street, and quickly took off the beggar's kimono. I had a disguise for my grandfather.
With a white head and a wrinkled face, he is clearly a retired man over sixty.
He straightened himself, put on the bamboo cane he was carrying, hunched over, and began to toddling.
Even if Mr. Hashiba ignores his promise and pursues him, there is no concern that he will be overlooked.
It's a very hard-to-find and thoughtful way of doing things.
When the old man came out onto the main street, he hailed a taxi and got in, but after driving it in a random direction for twenty minutes, he switched to another car, and this time the real secret was in trouble. did.
The place where the car stopped was the entrance of Toyamagahara.
The old man gets out of the car there and trudges across the pitch-black field.
Well, the thief's nest was in Toyamagahara.
At the edge of the field, in a thick cedar forest, there stands an old Western-style building.
It's a run down building that you don't even want to live in.
The old man tapped the door of the Western-style building three times, paused, and then tapped twice.
Then, thinking that this was a companion, the door was opened from inside, and one of the underlings who had begun to steal the Buddha statue suddenly appeared.
The old man stood in front of the room without saying a word, and went steadily into the back.
At the end of the corridor, there is a large room that must have once been quite splendid. Illuminated by a bright light.
"
All right.
You guys did a great job.
This is a reward.
Go somewhere and play.
”
After giving the three people a few thousand-yen bills and making them leave the room, the old man slowly removed the cloth from the glass box, held the naked candle that was there in one hand, and placed it in front of the Buddha statue. I stood up and opened the glass door that was the hinged door.
"
Goddess of Mercy, what kind of skill is your twenty-faced face?
Yesterday it was a diamond worth 2 million yen, and today it is a national treasure class work of art.
At this rate, the large museum I'm planning will be completed soon.
Hahaha……, Kannon-sama.
You're doing really well.
It looks like it's alive.
”
But then, dear reader.
Just as Twenty Faces' monologue never came to an end, just as he had said, a truly terrifying miracle happened.
Didn't the wooden Kannon's right hand stretch forward?
Moreover, in his fingers, instead of the usual lotus stalks, he held a pistol, perfectly aimed at the thief's chest.
A Buddha statue cannot move by itself.
Then, was this Kannon equipped with a mechanical mechanism like an artificial human being?
However, there is no such mechanism in the statues of the Kamakura period.
So how did this miracle happen?
But the Twenty-Faced Face, who had the pistol pointed at him, had no time to think about such things.
He
"
Oh.
”
While yelling and leaning back, I involuntarily raised my hands up to my shoulders as if to say I wouldn't hurt my hands.
Even the phantom thief was horrified at this.
If the opponent is a human being, no matter how many pistols are pointed at him, he is not a thief, but I can't help but be surprised when the Kannon of the old Kamakura period suddenly starts to move.
Rather than being surprised, I was horrified from the bottom of my heart.
It's an indescribable terror, like having a scary dream or encountering a ghost.
The poor daring Twenty-Faced Face straightened up, staggered backwards, apologized, put the candle on the floor, and raised both hands high.
Then, again, the most terrible thing happened.
The goddess Kannon got down from the renge pedestal and stood up on the floor.
Then, one step, two steps, three steps closer to the thief, aiming the pistol still.
"
Who are you?
”
Twenty Faces groaned like a cornered beast.
"
I'm here to take back the Hashiba family's diamonds.
If you give me that right now, I'll save your life.
"
To my surprise, the Buddha statue said something.
I gave the order in a loud voice.
"
Hahaha, you're the Hashiba family's mawashimono.
You disguised yourself as a Buddha statue and came to find my secret.
”
The thief cheered up a little when he realized that he was human.
However, the fear of the unknown has not completely disappeared.
Because the Buddha statue was too small for a human to disguise himself.
When he stood up, he was no taller than a twelve or three-year-old child.
That Issun-boshi-like guy is calm and speaks with the solemn voice of an old man.
"
And what if I don't give you the diamond?
"
The thief timidly asked him to try to get his attention.
"
You're just going to lose your life.
This pistol isn't the kind of toy you always use.
"
Kannon seemed to know perfectly well that this retired white-haired old man was in fact in disguise with twenty faces.
Perhaps he overheard a conversation with one of his underlings, and guessed it.
"
Shall I show you that it's not a toy?
”
When I thought about that, Kannon's right hand moved.
At the same time, there was a terrifying sound that made me jump up.
The windowpane on one side of the room rattled off.
Live bullets flew out of the pistol.
Issun-boshi Kannon glanced at the flying shards of glass and quickly returned the pistol to its original aim. With a black face like an Indian, he gave a faint, nasty grin. .
When I looked at it, pale blue smoke was still rising from the mouth of the pistol that was attached to the thief's chest.
Twenty Faces was horrified by this little black-faced monstrosity.
Such a messed-up ruffian has no idea what he's doing.
I don't think he really wants to kill him with a pistol.
Even if the bullet escaped successfully, if there was such a loud noise, the local residents would be suspicious of what would happen.
"
oh well.
I'll give you back the diamonds.
”
The thief gave up and went to the front of a large desk in the corner of the room, took out six jewels from a hidden drawer cut out from the legs of the desk, placed them on the palm of his hand, and returned with a clattering sound. I came.
Every time the diamond dances in the thief's hand, it catches the light of the candles on the floor and sparkles like a rainbow.
"
Here it is.
Take it carefully.
”
Issun-boshi Kannon stretched out his left hand and received it, laughing with a hoarse voice like an old man.
"
Hahaha... Impressed, impressed, as expected of the Twenty Faces, life seems to be precious after all.
”
"
Umm, I'm sorry, but I sewed a helmet.
"
The thief, biting his lips with regret,
"
By the way, who are you?
Even I was surprised that someone could put this 20-faced face on like this.
For posterity's sake, can you tell me your name?
”
"
Hahaha... It's an honor to receive your praise.
First name.
I'll leave that for your enjoyment after you go to jail.
I'm sure the old lady will tell you.
"
The goddess of mercy said triumphantly, but still, with her pistol still in her hand, began to scurry back toward the exit of the room.
We've located the thief's lair, recovered the diamonds, and all that's left is to leave the hovel and call the local police.
Readers, I'm sure you already know who this person disguised as Kannon is.
Young Kobayashi turned the phantom thief with twenty faces over and won a spectacular victory.
How happy was that?
He is a big man who is far superior to any adult.
But now, just as he was taking a few steps out of the room, a strange laughter suddenly rang out.
When I looked at it, I saw the old man with twenty faces laughing out loud, as if he couldn't help but laugh.
Oh dear readers, we are still not at ease.
My name is Kaito.
Even if you look like you've lost, it doesn't mean you haven't left any final trump cards.
"
Hey guys, what's wrong?
”
The boy disguised as Kannon stopped in shock and straightened himself up.
"
No, shit, shit, you've been using adult language and being so complicated that I just burst out laughing.
”
The thief finally stopped laughing and answered.
"
I mean.
Because I finally lost sight of your true identity.
There aren't many people who can outwit this Twenty Faces and do such tricks.
To tell the truth, the first thing that came to my mind was Akechi Kogoro.
But there is no such tiny Kogoro Akechi.
You are a child
When it comes to children who have mastered the Akechi style, there is no one else.
Akechi's boy assistant, Yoshio Kobayashi.
Hahaha……, what do you think?
”
Kobayashi, disguised as a statue of Kannon, couldn't help but be shocked at the robber's observation.
However, if you think about it carefully, now that you have achieved your purpose, you will not be surprised at all if someone steals your name.
"
I don't care what my name is, but I must be a child, you guessed it.
However, it would be a little disappointing for someone with twenty faces to be defeated by a child like me.
Hahaha…….
"
Young Kobayashi responded without losing.
"
Boy, you're so cute...
So you think you won against this Twenty Faces?
”
"
Forgive yourself for losing.
The Buddha statues that were stolen are now alive and moving, and the diamonds have been replaced, but are they still not defeated?
"
"
that's right.
I will never lose.
”
"
So what are you going to do!
”
"
I'm going to do this!
”
At the same time, Kobayashi felt as if the floorboards under his feet had suddenly disappeared.
Suddenly, my body flew into the air, and in the next moment, sparks flew in front of my eyes, and somewhere in my body I felt a terrible pain, as if it had been struck with a terrible force. is.
Oh, what a blunder!
Just then, the floorboards where he was standing had turned into a trap, and the thief's finger gently pushed the hidden button on the wall. The mouth was open.
Unable to endure the pain, unable to move, Kobayashi was lying face down in the depths of darkness.
"
Hahaha... Hey boy, that must have been painful.
I don't like it.
Well, think about it slowly.
See how powerful your enemies are.
Hahaha... you were a little too young to beat this Twenty Faces.
Hahaha…….
"
For almost twenty minutes, young Kobayashi sat still in the darkness of the earth, in an awkward posture.
I hit my back so badly that I couldn't even bring myself to move because of the pain.
In the meantime, Twenty Faces threw a great deal of taunts on the ceiling and slammed the lid of the old man down.
There is no hope of salvation.
I am captivated forever.
If the thieves refuse to give me food, I will have to die in the basement of the hovel where no one knows.
As a young boy, how can I endure this terrible situation?
Most boys would have burst into tears of despair from loneliness and fear.
But Kobayashi neither cried nor despaired.
To his credit, he still didn't think he had lost to Twenty Faces.
When the pain in his lower back finally subsided, the first thing the boy did was to touch a small canvas bag that he had hidden under his disguise and slung over his shoulder.
"
Pippo-chan, are you a jerk?
"
While saying strange things, I stroked it from above, and something small moved inside the bag.
"
Ah, Pippo didn't hit anywhere.
As long as you're here, I don't feel lonely at all.
"
After confirming that Pippo-chan was alive and well, Kobayashi sat down in the darkness, removed the small bag from his shoulder, took out a fountain-pen-shaped flashlight, and illuminated the floor with its light. He picked up six diamonds and a pistol that had been scattered around the house, and as he put them in his bag, he carefully inspected the various items inside to see if they had been lost.
There, the boy detective's seven tools were properly arranged.
It is said that once upon a time, a mighty man named Musashibo Benkei walked with all the tools of war on his back.
"
Benkei's seven utensils
"
It is still being talked about to this day.
Kobayashi Boy's
"
seven detective tools
”
The weapons weren't that big, they were all small enough to be held in both hands, but they never deceived Benkei's seven utensils.
Fountain pen flashlight.
Lights are the most important thing in the night investigation business.
This flashlight can also sometimes act as a signal.
Then a small utility knife.
It has a variety of folding blades such as saws, scissors, and awls.
and a ladder made of strong silk cord, which, when folded, is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
Other items included a fountain-pen-type telescope, a watch, magnets, a small notebook and pencil, and a small pistol that had terrified thieves.
No, there's one more thing we shouldn't forget about Pippo.
When I saw it illuminated by the flashlight, it was a single pigeon.
A cute pigeon crouched and sat quietly in another compartment of the bag.
"
Pippo-chan.
It's tight, but I'll endure it a little more.
It's hard to find a scary uncle.
"
When Kobayashi said that and stroked his head, the pigeon Pippo-chan replied with a coo-coo, as if he understood what he was saying.
Pippo-chan was the boy detective's mascot.
He had a kind of belief that if he was with this mascot, he would be fine in any danger.
That's not all.
This pigeon still had a serious role besides being a mascot.
For detective work, the communication agency is more important than anything else.
For that purpose, the police have cars equipped with radios, but the private detectives, unfortunately, do not.
It would be best if there was a small radio transmitter that you could hide under your clothes, but since you don't need such a thing, Kobayashi thought of an interesting method called a carrier pigeon.
It was a very childish idea.
But children's wild ideas sometimes have effects that surprise adults.
"
I have my radio in my bag, and I have my plane.
"
There was a time when young Kobayashi said something like that to himself, with a vaguely reluctant look.
Indeed, the homing pigeon is both a radio and an airplane.
Now, when he finished checking the seven tools, he hid his bag under his clothes with a satisfied expression, and then began to examine the basement with a flashlight.
The basement was about ten tatami mats in size, surrounded by four concrete walls, and seemed to have been used as a storeroom before.
Thinking that there must be a staircase somewhere, I looked for it and found a large wooden ladder hanging from the ceiling in one side of the room.
It must be said that it is a very cautious method to take up the stairs instead of just blocking the doorway.
At this rate, I can't imagine escaping the basement.
In the corner of the room there was a long chair that was about to break and an old blanket rolled up on top of it, but there was not a single thing that looked like a tool.
It feels like a prison.
Looking at the long chair, Kobayashi thought of something.
"
Souji Hashiba must have been confined in this basement.
And he must have fallen asleep on this long chair.
”
Thinking that, he felt a sense of nostalgia, and he approached the long chair, pushed the cushions, and spread out the blankets.
"
Well then, I wonder if I'll take a nap in this bed too.
”
The fearless boy detective said that to himself and lay down on the long chair.
All will be after dawn.
By then, I have to be sharp enough.
Well, the reasoning is true, but it was impossible for an ordinary boy to fall asleep in such a dreadful situation.
"
Pippo-chan, let's go to sleep.
And let's have a funny dream.
"
Kobayashi carefully took Pippo's bag into the bag and closed his eyes in the darkness.
And soon, from the bed of the long chair, I could hear the peaceful breathing of the boy asleep.
When Kobayashi suddenly woke up, he was surprised to find that the room looked different from his usual bedroom at the detective agency, but he immediately remembered what had happened last night.
"
Ah, you were imprisoned in the basement.
But it's strangely bright in the basement.
”
The drab concrete walls and floors look slightly brighter.
As I continued to look round the basement, for there was no way that the sun could shine through it, I noticed, though I hadn't noticed it at all last night, that there was a small light-filled window near the ceiling on the other side. .
The window is very small, about thirty centimeters square, and is fitted with thick iron bars.
From the floor of the basement, it's nearly three meters high, but from the outside, it must be barely touching the ground.
"
Hate, I wonder if I can manage to escape from that window.
”
Kobayashi quickly got up from his long chair, went under the window, and looked up at the bright sky.
The windows were covered with glass, but if you shouted because the glass was broken, it seemed that people passing by could hear you.
So I put the long chair I had been sleeping on under the window and used it as a stepping stone to climb up, but I still couldn't reach the window.
A child can't lift a heavy long chair, and I can't find any other tool that can be used as a stepping stone.
Then, even though Kobayashi found the window, couldn't he have been able to look outside?
No, dear readers, don't worry.
There is a rope ladder to prepare for such a time.
The boy detective's seven tools were immediately put to use.
He took a silk rope ladder out of his bag, extended it, gave it momentum like a cowboy's lasso, and threw the hook on the other side against the window rail. .
After failing three or four times, I felt a solid response.
The key was successfully hooked to a single iron bar.
As for the rope ladder, it's a very simple one. A long, sturdy silk string about 5 meters long is attached with a large musubi-dama every 20 centimeters. It's a way to climb up by putting your toes on it.
Kobayashi may not be as strong as an adult, but when it comes to gymnastics, he is second to none.
He was able to climb a ladder and hold on to the window sill.
However, upon further investigation, I discovered, to my disappointment, that the iron was so deeply embedded in the concrete that it was impossible to remove it with a utility knife.
How about calling out for help from the window?
No, there is almost no prospect of that either.
Outside the window was a desolate garden overgrown with grass and trees.
If even children come to play in that open space and ask for help, they will ask for help, but it is doubtful whether their voices will reach that far.
Besides, if you yelled out in such a loud voice, Twenty Faces would have heard you before the people in the area could hear you.
No, no, can you do such a dangerous thing?
Young Kobayashi was utterly disappointed.
But even in the disappointment, there was one big harvest.
For until now I had no idea where this building was, but when I looked through the window I knew exactly where it was.
Readers may say that it is difficult to know the location just by looking through the window.
But it turns out.
Mr. Kobayashi was very lucky.
Outside the window, far beyond the vast expanse, I could see a building with a striking character, the only one in Tokyo.
Readers in Tokyo must be familiar with the large concrete building in Toyamagahara, which looks like an array of kamaboko from the Otona-no-kuni.
Isn't it a sign of a custom order?
The boy detective kept in mind the relationship between the building and the thief's house, and climbed down the ladder.
I hurriedly opened my bag, took out a notebook, a pencil, and a magnet, and drew a map while checking the direction.
Then, I could clearly see that this building was located on the north side of Toyamagahara, in a corner from the west.
Here again, the magnets in the seven tools came in handy.
When I looked at the clock, it was just past 6:00 in the morning.
The silence in the room above suggested that Twenty Faces was still asleep.
"
Oh, I'm sorry.
You've gone to great lengths to find the secret of Twenty Faces, and even though you know exactly where it is, you still can't arrest the thief.
”
Kobayashi clenched his small fist and groaned.
"
I wish I could be small like a fairy fairy, grow wings and jump out of that window.
If I did that, I would have immediately notified the Metropolitan Police Department, guided the police, and captured Twenty Faces.
”
He sighed at the thought of such a dream, but suddenly, with the help of such a dream, a brilliant idea came to him.
"
Hey, I'm an idiot.
You can do that without any reason.
I have an airplane called Pippo-chan.
"
When I think about it, my face turns red and my heart starts pounding with joy.
With his hands shaking with excitement, Kobayashi marked in his notebook the location of the thieves' nest and the fact that he was being confined in the basement.
Then, I took out Pippo-chan, the homing pigeon, from my bag, stuffed the current notebook paper into the communication tube attached to its leg, and closed the lid tightly.
"
Come on, Pippo, it's finally time for you to put your hands up.
I'll do my best.
I don't eat road grass.
Mind you.
Hey, jump out that window and hurry to your wife.
”
Pippo-chan sat on the back of Kobayashi's hand and listened intently with cute eyes rolling around. When I went back and forth, I jumped out of the window.
"
Oh good.
In ten minutes, Pippo-chan will run to Akechi-sensei's aunt.
I'm sure your aunt will be very surprised when she reads my letter.
But I'm sure he'll call the Metropolitan Police Department soon.
Thirty minutes until the cops show up here?
Forty minutes?
In any case, an hour from now the thief will be caught.
And I can get out of this hole.
"
Young Kobayashi was thinking about these things while looking at the sky where Pippo-chan had disappeared.
I was so irritated that I didn't even notice the opening of the drop-hole in the ceiling.
"
Mr. Kobayashi, what are you doing in such a place?
"
The familiar voice of Twenty Faces struck the boy's ears like thunder.
When I looked up in shock, I saw the face of a white-headed thief from last night, upside down, peeking through a square hole in the ceiling.
Ah, then you must have seen Pippo-chan fly away.
Kobayashi unintentionally changed his complexion and stared at the bandit's face.
"
Boy Detective, how was your sleep last night?
Hahaha... Oh, there's a black string hanging from the window.
Haha, it's a ready-made ladder.
Admiration, admiration, you are a very thoughtful child.
But the iron bar on the window cannot be removed by your own strength.
No matter how long you stand there and stare at the window, you can't run away.
It's sickening.
"
The thief sneered and mocked him.
"
hi good morning
I don't think I'll run away.
It's comfortable.
I like this room.
I'm going to take it easy.
”
Kobayashi boy was not defeated either.
My heart was pounding, thinking that the thief might have picked up on the homing pigeon that had just flown out of the window. I'm sorry.
If even Pippo-chan could come to the detective agency on time, I'd be done with it.
No matter how much Twenty-Faced Faces lash out at him, it's nothing.
Because we know that the final victory is ours.
"
Are you comfortable?
Hahaha... I'm even more impressed.
As expected of Akechi's right-hand man, he's got a lot of guts.
But Mr. Kobayashi, don't you have something to worry about?
Well, you must be hungry already.
Are you saying I can die?
”
what are you talking about
Don't you know that Pippo-chan's report will bring a lot of police officers to the scene?
Mr. Kobayashi didn't say anything, but was laughing in his heart.
"
Hahaha... you seem a little disappointed.
Shall I tell you something good?
You will pay the price.
If you do, I'll let you eat a delicious breakfast.
No, it's not money.
The price for the meal is the pistol you have.
If you gently pull the pistol over here, I'll tell the cook to bring you breakfast right away.
"
Although the thief made a big point, he still hated the pistol.
It was a good idea to take that as the price of the meal.
Kobayashi believed that he would eventually be rescued, so there was nothing wrong with holding back from eating until then, but he looked so unconcerned that he didn't want the other person to quarrel with him. I thought.
Besides, I don't have any more business with the pistol anyway.
"
I'm sorry, but I will accept your offer.
I'm really hungry.
”
I deliberately replied frustrated.
The thief didn't realize that it was a play, and just thought that the ruse had struck a chord.
"
Ufufufu... It seems that even a boy detective can't compete with hunger.
All right, I'll get you some food right now.
”
As he said that, he closed his pit and disappeared, but before long, he heard a faint voice from the ceiling that seemed to be giving orders to the cook.
About twenty minutes after that, Twenty Faces, puzzled by the preparations for the meal, opened the pit to reveal his face again.
"
Come on, I brought you some hot food.
But let me give you the price first.
Now put the pistol in this basket.
"
A small basket with a rope slipped by.
Kobayashi put the pistol into it, and the basket was quickly hoisted to the ceiling, and when it came down again, it contained three steaming rice balls. There were ham, raw eggs, and a bottle of tea.
For a captive, it is quite a feast.
"
Come on, eat slowly.
As long as you pay the price, I'll treat you as much as you want.
For lunch, it's diamonds.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'll give you one grain at a time.
No matter how much I'm sorry, I can't change my hunger.
In other words, the diamond should be completely returned.
One grain at a time, one grain at a time, hahaha... The owner of the hotel is also quite a pleasure.
"
Twenty Faces seemed to enjoy this strange bargain.
However, with such long-winded words, can diamonds really replace them?
Before that, isn't he going to be captivated himself?
Twenty Faces was still squatting by the door, and the pistol he had just picked up was bouncing in the palm of his hand.
And it was time to say something, still trying to make fun of the boy Kobayashi.
There was a clattering sound coming down from the second floor, and the cook's frightened face appeared.
"
It's hard....
There are three cars, and there are a lot of police officers driving them...
When I was watching from the window on the second floor, it stopped outside the gate...
I have to run away quickly.
"
Ah, so Pippo-chan has accomplished his mission.
And the police had already arrived earlier than Kobayashi had thought.
In the basement, the detective boy hears the commotion and is overwhelmed with joy.
In this unexpected moment, I can't help but be astonished at the Twenty Faces.
"
what?
"
I groaned and jumped to my feet, forgetting to shut the door, and rushed to the front entrance.
But by then it was too late.
A loud knock was heard from outside the entrance door.
When I looked through the peephole by the door, I saw a uniformed policeman outside.
"
Damn it.
"
Twenty Faces, now trembling with anger, ran toward the back door.
But before he had even made it halfway, he heard a violent knock at the back door.
The robber's lair was now completely surrounded by the police.
"
I don't know, I can't do it anymore.
There is no escape.
”
The cook let out a cry of despair.
"
It can't be helped, it's on the second floor.
"
Twenty Faces wants to hide in the attic on the second floor.
"
Very bad.
I will find you soon.
"
The cook roared in a tearful voice.
The thief didn't care, but suddenly took the man's hand and dragged him up the stairs to the attic.
Not long after they disappeared on the stairs, the front door made a loud bang, and as I thought it had collapsed, several policemen rushed into the house.
Almost at the same time, the back door was opened, and several uniformed police officers came through.
The commander is Chief Investigator Nakamura himself, who was called the demon of the Metropolitan Police Department.
The chief of the section had police officers stationed at key points in the front and back of the building, and ordered the rest to search every room.
"
Ah, it's here.
This is the basement.
”
A policeman yelled at the old door.
People rushed in, and one of them was crouching down and peering into the dark basement.
"
There is.
Are you Mr. Kobayashi?
”
When I called out, the boy who was waiting for me said,
"
that's right.
Please put down the ladder quickly.
"
I shouted.
Meanwhile, the rooms downstairs have been combed through, but the thief is nowhere to be seen.
"
Kobayashi-kun, do you know where Twenty Faces went?
"
Chief Nakamura finally caught the strangely dressed boy crawling out of the basement and asked him hastily.
"
Not long ago I was at this closet.
You shouldn't have run away.
Isn't it on the second floor?
"
Just as Kobayashi had finished speaking, an unusual scream rang out from upstairs.
"
Hurry up, thief, I caught the thief!
”
That's why people rushed to the stairs at the end of the corridor in an avalanche.
There was a loud pounding sound of footsteps, and when I climbed the stairs, I found myself in an attic room with only one small window, and it was as dark as the evening.
"
It's here, it's here
Please help me quickly.
"
In the darkness, a policeman is yelling at an old man with white hair and beard.
The old man seemed quite formidable, and was likely to rebound, and was barely able to grapple.
Only two or three of them were immediately grappling with the old man.
After him, four, five, six, all the policemen bent over and rushed upon the thief.
At this point, not even the most thugs could resist.
In a blink of an eye, I was scolded by Takate and Kote.
When the white-haired old man was exhausted and crouched in a corner of the room, Chief Nakamura came up with Kobayashi.
It's for a head test.
"
Twenty Faces must be this guy.
”
When the chief asked, the boy nodded his head,
"
that's right.
This guy.
Twenty Faces is disguised as such an old man.
”
I answered.
"
You guys, put it in the car.
Keep it dry.
”
At the command of the chief of staff, the policemen hauled the old man down the stairs from all four sides.
"
Mr. Kobayashi, you were a major player.
When Mr. Akechi returns from abroad, he will surely be surprised.
Because the opponent is a big man called Twenty Faces.
Tomorrow, your name will be heard all over Japan.
"
Chief Nakamura took the great detective boy's hand and squeezed it tightly as if he were grateful.
Thus, the battle ended in victory for Kobayashi boy.
I didn't have to hand over the Buddha statue from the beginning, and all six diamonds were neatly stored in my bag.
It was a victory, a victory, a perfect victory.
Not only was the thief unable to obtain anything in spite of all his painstaking efforts, but Kobayashi's boy, who had gone to great lengths to imprison him, was rescued, and he himself was finally taken captive. .
"
I feel like I'm lying.
I can't believe I won Twenty Faces.
"
Kobayashi's face turned pale with excitement, and he said something unbelievable.
But there is one thing that the boy detective completely forgot in his joy at the arrest of the thief.
That is the whereabouts of the cook who had taken Twenty Faces.
Where did the cloud take him?
Isn't it strange that he never showed up in such a house search?
I don't think he had time to escape.
If the cook had the ability to run away, Twenty Faces should have run away.
So is he still hiding somewhere indoors?
It's just not possible.
It is unthinkable that such an oversight was involved in the thorough search by a large police force.
Readers, take a book and think about it.
What kind of meaning is hidden in the strange unknown whereabouts of this cook in the first place?
About two hours after the Toyamagahara abandoned house was captured, the Kaito Twenty Faces was interrogated in the gloomy investigative room of the Metropolitan Police Department.
In a dimly lit room with no decorations, there was a single desk, and there was Chief Investigator Nakamura and the phantom thief disguised as an old man, facing each other.
The thief stands in the way of the arrogant, with his hands tied behind his back.
From the very beginning, he was as silent as an idiot and never said a word.
"
One, let me show you your true face.
”
The chief went to the thief and suddenly put his hand on his white wig and pulled it off.
Then, a black head appeared from underneath.
Next, I plucked off the false mustache that covered my face.
And finally, the real face of the thief was exposed.
"
Oh my goodness, you're such a man.
”
It was understandable that the chief of staff said so and made a strange face.
The thief has a narrow forehead, short, crumpled and uneven eyebrows, an acorn that glistens under it, a flattened nose, thick, loose lips, and a savage-like, savage-like, unsophisticated look. It was a strange relationship.
As I said earlier, this thief has many different faces, and depending on the situation, he is a monster that can take the form of an old man, a young man, or even a woman. But I had no idea what it really looked like.
Anyway, what an ugly face this is.
Maybe this barbarian-like face is just a disguise.
Chief Nakamura felt something indescribable.
The foreman glared at the bandit's face and couldn't help but raise his voice.
"
Hey, is this your true face?
"
This is a really weird question.
But I felt compelled to ask such a silly question.
Then the phantom thief kept his head still, his loose lips tightened even more, and began to grin.
Seeing that, Chief Nakamura was horrified for some reason.
I had the feeling that something unimaginably strange was happening before my eyes.
As if to hide his fear, the foreman moved closer to him and suddenly raised both hands and began to fiddle with the thief's face.
I try to pull my eyebrows, hold my nose, pinch my cheeks, and it seems like I'm playing with a toy.
However, no matter how much I investigated, the thief did not appear to be disguised.
It is truly surprising that the thief who once pretended to be that handsome young man, Souichi Hashiba, had such a ugly, monster-like face.
"
Ehehehe... tickle me, okay, tickle me.
"
The thief finally spoke up.
But what sloppy words!
Is he trying to fool the police by lying about how he speaks?
Or maybe...
The chief was startled and glared at the thief again.
A wild idea flashed through my head.
Oh how could that be?
It's such a ridiculous fantasy.
It's just not possible.
But the chief of staff had to make sure of it.
"
Who are you?
Who the hell are you?
"
Again, this is a silly question.
Then the thief responded to the voice and answered as if he was waiting.
"
My name is Torakichi Kinoshita.
Occupation is a cook.
"
"
Shut up!
You can't try to cover it up with such a foolish mouth.
Tell the truth.
Speaking of Twenty Faces, isn't it a great thief that the world heard about?
Don't pretend.
”
I was yelled at, and I didn't know what to do.
Didn't the thief suddenly burst into laughter?
"
Hey, is it me with 20 faces?
Hahaha... it's going to be crazy.
Do you think Twenty Faces is such a nasty man?
Even the police have no eyes.
Don't you think it's easy to understand?
”
Chief Nakamura couldn't help but change his complexion when he heard that.
"
Shut up, don't care about bullshit.
Is there such a thing as nonsense?
Young Kobayashi has proved that you have twenty faces.
"
"
Wahahaha... that's wrong, so come on.
I don't remember doing anything wrong, I'm just a cook.
I don't know if it's Twenty Faces, but it's Torakichi, the cook who was sent to that house about ten days ago.
If you ask the master cook, you'll know right away.
”
"
Why is that innocent cook disguised as such an old man?
"
"
Then suddenly I was held down, forced to change my kimono, and put a wig on my head.
I don't really know why, but when the policeman stepped on me, my husband took my hand and ran up to the attic.
There's a hidden cupboard in that room, and there's all kinds of disguise clothes.
My husband took out the policeman's clothes and a hat from among them, quickly put them on, put me in the old man's kimono, and suddenly said, 'I've caught a thief.
’ and I held him down so that he could not move.
Now that I think about it, it was a play in which a police officer under the inspector discovered Twenty Faces and suddenly jumped at him.
It's dark in the attic.
In that turmoil, I don't know your face.
I couldn't do anything.
After all, when it comes to my husband, I'm from the top.
"
Chief Nakamura, with a pale and stiff face, silently rang the bell on the table.
When the inspector appeared, he ordered the four policemen who were guarding the front and back entrances of the abandoned house in Kesado Yamagahara to come immediately.
After a while, the chief of staff glared at the four policemen who entered.
"
Did anyone leave the house when you were arresting this guy?
He may have been dressed as a police officer.
Didn't you see someone?
"
A police officer answered the question.
"
If he was a police officer, he would have left alone.
We yelled out that the thief had been caught and that we should go upstairs.
”
"
Why have you kept it to yourself until now?
First of all, did you not see the man's face?
No matter how much you wear a police uniform, you should be able to tell if you're a fake just by looking at his face.
”
The chief's forehead is terribly swollen with veins.
"
That's why I didn't have time to look at his face.
It ran like the wind and flew like the wind.
However, I was a little confused, so I asked him where he was going.
Then the man ran away, shouting, "It's a phone call. I'm going to make a phone call at the command of the chief of staff."
If it's a phone call, it's not unheard of until now, so I didn't ask for more.
Besides, the thief had been caught, so he forgot about the police who had run out, and didn't report it.
"
If you ask me, it was a story without impossibility.
I couldn't help but be surprised at how agile and well-prepared the thief's plan was.
There's nothing more to complain about.
The barbarian-looking man standing here was no phantom thief.
He was nothing more than a boring cook.
Thinking that a dozen or so police officers had made such a fuss in order to catch that petty cook, the chief and the four police officers couldn't help but look at each other in daze. .
"
Then, Mr. Inspector, my husband asked me to give it to you, and I wrote this.
"
Torakichi, the cook, opened Jutoku's chest, took out a crumpled piece of paper, and held it out in front of the chief.
Chief Nakamura snatched it up, smoothed out his wrinkles, and read it quickly. As he read, his face seemed to turn purple with rage.
Written on it were the following ridiculous words:
Please say hello to Kobayashi-kun.
That is a great child.
I can't help but think it's cute.
But no matter how cute Kobayashi-kun is, I can't sacrifice myself.
I'm sorry for that kid who depends on victory, but I gave him a little real-world lesson.
Please tell me that I should give up on fighting this twenty-faced face with the skinny arms of a child.
Please tell me that if I don't stick to this, I'll be in big trouble.
By the way, let the police officers know a little bit of my plan.
Mr. Hashiba became a little annoyed.
I won't bother you any more.
To tell you the truth, I can't stay attached to such a meager art room forever.
I am busy.
Actually, I'm trying to get my hands on something bigger now.
What kind of big business it is, you will soon hear about it.
Let's meet again soon.
Zenshiro Nakamura from Twenty Faces Dear readers, the battle between Twenty Faces and Kobayashi boy ended up with a victory for the phantom thief.
What's more, Twenty Faces mocks the Hashiba family's treasury as poor and says that he is busy with big projects.
What does his big business mean?
This time, Kobayashi boy may not be able to handle it anymore.
What awaits is the return of Kogoro Akechi.
It's not too far off, either.
Ah, the confrontation between the famous detective Kogoro Akechi and the Fiend with Twenty Faces, and the battle between wisdom and wisdom, aren't you waiting for that day?
About four kilometers south of Shuzenji Onsen on the Izu Peninsula, in the mountains along the Shimoda Highway, there is a very lonely village called Taniguchi Village.
In the woods on the outskirts of the village, there stands a majestic fortress like a splendid castle.
A high earthen wall was built around it, and sharp iron bars were planted on the earthen wall like mountains of needles. It's soaring and the water is lush.
The depth is so deep that you can't stand your back.
This is all a precaution to keep people away.
Even if you climb over the earthen wall of Needle Mountain, there is a moat inside that you cannot jump out of.
And in the middle of it, there is no castle tower, but there is a large building with thick white walls and small windows that looks like a collection of earthen storehouses.
People in the neighborhood say that this building
"
Kusakabe Castle
"
Although it is called a castle, it is of course not a real castle.
There shouldn't be a castle in such a small village.
Who, then, is home to this absurdly cautious building?
In the Warring States period, when there were no police, no rich man would live in a mansion so cautious in this world.
"
What kind of people live in Asuko?
”
When asked about travel, the villagers routinely answer like this.
"
Is that it?
Ah, Kusakabe's crazy husband's castle.
He says he's afraid of his treasure being stolen, so he doesn't keep in touch with the village.
”
For generations, the Kusakabe family was a large landowner in this region, but in the current Samon era, the vast estate was completely taken over, and what remains is a castle-like mansion and its surroundings. It has become only a large number of old masterpieces in the collection.
Old Samon was a crazy art collector.
Even though we call it art, it is mainly ancient masterpieces, and it could be said that the works of ancient masters such as Sesshu and Tan'yu, whose names even appear in elementary school books, are almost without exception.
It was rumored that most of the hundreds of paintings were masterpieces worthy of national treasures, and that they would cost billions of yen.
Now you can see why the Kusakabe family's estate is as guarded as a castle.
Samon old man cared more about those masterpieces than his own life.
I couldn't forget the worry that I might be stolen by a thief.
Even after digging a moat and planting needles on the wall, there is still no relief.
In the end, when I saw a visitor's face, they would suspect that I had come to steal the painting, and I stopped associating with the honest villagers.
Old Samon shut himself up in the castle all year round, looking at the masterpieces he had collected, but rarely went out.
I was so involved in art that I never got a wife, and therefore had no children.
In other words, the old man was a strange lord of the castle of art.
Today, too, the old man was sitting in a deep room in a white-walled storehouse-like building, surrounded by masterpieces of the past and present, as if dreaming.
The sun was shining brightly outside, but the room was cold and dark, like a prison, with only small windows that had been reinforced with iron as a precaution.
"
Husband, please keep it open.
I have received your letter.
”
I heard the voice of an old servant outside the room.
The only servants in the large mansion are the old man and his wife.
"
letter?
It's rare.
bring it here
"
When the old man answered, the heavy wooden door rattled open, and an old man, who was as crumpled as his master, entered with a letter in his hand.
Old Samon took it and looked at the back, but strangely enough, the name of the sender was not there.
"
From whom?
It's an unseen letter, but...
”
The address was indeed Kusakabe Samon-sama, so I opened the envelope and read it.
"
Good morning, husband, what happened?
Is there anything written that worries you?
”
Involuntarily, the old man let out a frightening cry.
That's how old Samon's appearance changed.
His wrinkled, beardless face was shriveled, his toothless lips quivering, and his small eyes gleamed anxiously behind his reading glasses.
"
No, no, nothing.
You don't know.
go away
"
I scolded him with a trembling voice, and chased him away.
The letter contained the following terrifying words.
Please forgive my sudden request without an introduction.
However, even without an introduction, I am sure that you are well aware of who I am from the newspapers.
To put it simply, I have decided to give you all of your family's treasured old paintings.
I will definitely come to see you on the night of November 15th.
I would like to inform you in advance, as I would like to inform you in advance that I will be surprised if you suddenly come to me.
Twenty-Faced Souvenir Kusakabe Samon-dono Ah, the Phantom Thief with Twenty-Faced Faces has finally set his sights on this art collector in the mountains of Izu.
It's been almost a month since he disguised himself as a policeman and escaped from Toyamagahara.
No one knows where Kaito was and what he was doing during that time.
Perhaps he had created a new hideout, recruited his minions, and plotted a second and third dreadful scheme.
And the first place that was singled out was the Kusakabe family's art castle in an unexpected mountainous area.
"
The night of November 15th is tonight.
Oh what should I do
Since I was targeted by Twenty Faces, my treasure is as good as gone.
Isn't he a terrible thief that even the power of the Metropolitan Police Department couldn't do anything about?
This is beyond the reach of the local police.
Oh, I'm ruined
I'd rather die than have this treasure stolen from me.
"
Old Samon suddenly got up and began walking around the room, unable to stay still.
"
Oh, you're in luck.
There is no escape.
"
Before he knew it, the old man's pale, wrinkled face was wet with tears.
"
Oh, what was that... Oh, I just remembered.
I figured it out.
How come I hadn't noticed it until now?
……God hasn’t abandoned me yet.
If only he was here, I might be able to save him.
”
For some reason, the old man's face suddenly became lively.
"
Hey, Sakuzo, isn't Sakuzo here?
”
The old man went out of the room and, clapping his hands, called out to him.
Hearing the strange voice of my master, my grandfather rushed to me.
"
Hurry up and bring me the Izu Nippo.
I think it was the newspaper from the day before yesterday, but whatever you want, please bring me three or four days' worth of it all at once.
Hurry up, hurry up.
"
' he ordered in a frightening tone.
Sakuzo panicked and brought out the local newspaper, the Izu Nippo. There was an article in the news section that read:
Mr. Kogoro Akechi visits the repair Kogoro Akechi, the leading private detective, has been on a business trip abroad for a long time. I am planning to stay in Japan for 4-5 days.
"
This is it.
This is it.
Detective Akechi is the only person who can oppose Twenty Faces.
In the case of the theft of the Hashiba family, even my assistant, a child named Kobayashi, did such a great job.
If that teacher is Detective Akechi, he will surely save me from ruin.
No matter what happens, you must bring this great detective with you.
"
While muttering such things to himself, the old man called the wife of Sakuzo Grandpa to change his kimono. I sternly told him, as if I was watching over him, and went out with his family.
Needless to say, the destination is the nearby Shuzenji Onsen Fujiya Ryokan.
Go there, meet detective Akechi, and ask him to protect the treasure.
Ah, the long-awaited detective Kogoro Akechi has finally returned.
What's more, at any time, at any place, as if by arrangement, the Twenty Faces was about to set in, and whether or not he was coming to take a bath right near Mr. In fact, I must say that I am happy that I did not ask for it.
It was already around 1:00 PM when the small old man Samon, dressed in a mouse-colored kite, was about to run up a long slope and arrived at the Fujiya Ryokan.
"
What about Kogoro Akechi?
”
When I asked him, he answered that he had gone fishing in the valley river in the back.
So, I had to ask the maid to guide me back down to the valley.
After passing through a dangerous road, such as a bamboo grass, and descending into a deep valley, beautiful water was flowing with the sound of a stream.
Here and there, large rocks protrude like stepping stones.
On top of the largest flat rock, a man in a gauntlet, hunched over, stares into the tip of a hanging fishing rod.
"
That person is Professor Akechi.
"
The maid took the lead and hopped over the rocks as she approached the man.
"
Sensei, um, this person came all the way from afar to see Sensei.
”
Hearing that voice, the man in the slapstick look annoyed and turned around.
"
Do not speak loudly.
The fish will run away.
”
I scolded.
With scraggly hair, sharp eyes, a rather pale and tight face, a high nose, no beard, and strong lips, he must have been the famous detective Akechi, who I remember from photographs.
"
I am like this.
"
Old Samon held out his business card and said,
"
I went to the teacher and asked him if there was a request.
”
and bent down.
Detective Akechi accepted the business card, but didn't even look at it.
"
Oh, I see.
So what can I do for you?
”
That said, I'm still focused on the tip of the fishing rod.
The old man told the maid to go home first, and after watching the figure behind her,
"
Teacher, I actually received this letter today.
”
Then he took the notice of Twenty Faces from his pocket and thrust it out in front of the detective who was staring at the fishing rod.
"
Ah, I ran away again...
I'm sorry to bother you so much.
Letter?
What does that letter mean to me?
”
It seems that Akechi is just ignorant.
"
Sensei, don't you know the thief called Twenty Faces?
”
Old Samon got a little annoyed and let out a sharp sigh.
"
Hou, Twenty Faces?
Are you saying that Twenty Faces sent you a letter?
"
The great detective is not at all surprised, he is still staring at the tip of the fishing rod.
Thereupon, the old man had no choice but to read the phantom thief's notice to himself,
"
Castle
"
I told in detail what kind of treasures are hidden in
"
Oh, were you the owner of that strange castle?
”
Akechi finally seemed to be interested, and turned to face the old man.
"
Yes, it is.
Those old masterpieces are treasures that I cannot buy in my life.
Akechi-sensei, please help this old man.
Please.
"
"
And what do you want me to do?
"
"
I want you to come to my house at once.
And I want you to protect my treasure.
”
"
Have you reached out to the police?
Rather than talking to me, I think you should ask for police protection first.
”
"
Well, let me tell you, I rely more on the teacher than on the police.
I believe that there is no detective other than Sensei who can stand by his side with twenty faces.
Besides, we only have a small police station here, so it takes a long time to call a good detective.
After all, Twenty Faces is going to come over to me tonight.
You can't take it easy.
The fact that Sensei is visiting this hot spring on that very day is truly a gift from the gods.
Sensei, the old man is a lifelong request.
Please help me.
"
Old Samon scratched with his hands frothed.
"
If you say so much, let's accept it anyway.
Twenty Faces is also my enemy.
I've been waiting impatiently for it to appear soon.
Well then, shall we go together? Before that, we have to make a meeting with the police.
Let's go back to the inn and call me.
And to be ready, let's enlist the help of two or three detectives.
Please go home one step ahead.
I will rush over with the detective at once.
”
Akechi's tone suddenly became warmer.
I don't even look at the fishing rod anymore.
"
Thank you thank you.
I think I have a million friends now.
"
The old man stroked his chest and thanked him over and over again.
An old man, Samon Kusakabe, skipped the car he had bought in Shuzenji and headed for Taniguchi Village.
"
Castle
"
About 30 minutes after returning home, Kogoro Akechi and his party arrived.
In addition to Detective Akechi, who had changed into a black suit that fitted him perfectly, the group consisted of three gentlemen in business suits, all detectives from the police station. We exchanged greetings.
The old man immediately led the four of them into a hidden room of masterpieces, showing them the hanging scrolls lined up on the walls and the countless masterpieces of national treasure he had stored in boxes and stacked on shelves, and explained the origins of each one.
"
Well, what an amazing collection.
I also love old paintings, and when I have free time, I visit museums and temples to look at treasures, but I have never seen so many historical masterpieces gathered in one room. .
It's no surprise that the art-loving Twenty Faces caught your eye.
Even I am drooling.
”
Detective Akechi praised each and every one of the masterpieces, as though he were in a state of admiration. I was also surprised.
And my respect for the great detective grew even deeper.
Well, a little early, after dinner with everyone, it was finally decided that I would be assigned to the post of protection of masterpieces.
Akechi, in a brisk tone, instructed three detectives, one into the masterpiece room, one at the front gate, and one at the back door. It was even decided that when they saw the appearance of something, they would immediately blow the caller.
When the detectives arrived at their respective departments, Detective Akechi slammed the sturdy wooden door of the masterpiece room from the outside and forced the old man to lock it.
"
Let's say I've been working hard all night in front of this door.
"
The great detective said so and sat down in the tatami corridor in front of the wooden door.
"
Sensei, you'll be fine.
It may be rude to say this to the teacher, but he seems to be a wizard-like fellow.
I still feel uneasy.
”
Looking at Akechi's complexion, the old man asks inconsiderately.
"
Hahaha... don't worry.
As I had thoroughly examined earlier, the windows of the room are fitted with heavy iron bars, the walls are 30 centimeters thick, and they cannot be easily broken down. Detective-kun is staring at me, and on top of that, I'm working hard at the only entrance.
I can't be more careful than that.
You should rest easy and have a good night.
It's the same thing when you come here.
"
Even if Akechi recommends it, the old man will not accept it.
"
No, I will stay up all night here.
You can't go to bed and sleep.
"
With that said, I sat down beside the detective.
"
I see.
It's convenient for me to have someone to talk to.
Let's fight with painting theory.
"
As expected of a battle-hardened great detective, he is surprisingly calm.
After that, the two of them relaxed and began to talk about old masterpieces, but the only one who spoke was Akechi.
After a long time, to old Samon, it seemed as if a year had passed, and finally it was twelve o'clock.
It's midnight.
From time to time, Akechi called out to the detective in the room through the wooden door, but each time he heard a clear tone from inside saying that there was nothing wrong with him.
"
Ah, I'm getting a little sleepy.
"
Akechi yawned,
"
The Twenty Faces guy may not be here tonight.
After all, it's not a fool to jump into such serious vigilance...
How are you, old man?
One book for sleeping.
In foreign countries, such a luxury guy is doing a spa spa.
"
With that, he snapped open his tobacco pouch, picked up one himself, and held it out in front of the old man.
"
I guess so.
won't you come tonight?
"
Old Samon said uneasyly as he took the Egyptian tobacco that was offered to him.
"
No, don't worry.
He's no fool.
If they knew that I was doing my best here, they wouldn't come here.
”
After that, the two of them stopped talking for a while, and smoked happily while thinking about their thoughts.
"
I will sleep a little.
Good night to you too.
Hey, it's okay.
It is said that samurai are awakened by the sound of their bridle, but in my profession, I am awakened by the sound of any footsteps.
I don't let my heart fall asleep.
”
Just as I was about to say that, he lay down long in front of the wooden door, covering his eyes.
And soon, I began to hear soft and gentle breathing.
The old man is not bothered by the behavior of a detective who is too familiar.
Instead of sleeping, I strained my ears more and more, trying not to miss the slightest noise.
I feel like I'm hearing some strange sounds.
Was it the tinnitus, or the sound of the wind against the treetops of the nearby forest?
And if you listen carefully, you can clearly see that the night is falling silently.
The inside of my head gradually becomes empty, and the front of my eyes becomes blurry like a haze.
When I woke up, I saw a man in black clothes standing in the middle of the faint white haze.
"
Ah, Akechi-sensei, it's a thief, it's a thief.
"
Involuntarily, I let out a loud voice and shook the sleeping Akechi's shoulders.
"
What is it?
Isn't that annoying?
Where are the thieves?
You must have seen it in your dreams.
”
The detective did not move and told me to scold him.
I see, this may have been a dream, or an illusion.
No matter how much I looked around, the man in black was nowhere to be found.
A little embarrassed, the old man returned to his original position in silence and listened again. Yagamuragari begins.
The haze thickens little by little until it turns black like a black cloud. I'm sorry.
No matter how long I slept, I kept having horrible dreams, as if I had fallen into hell.
"
Oh, I must have been asleep.
However, I wondered why I slept or something when I was so tense.
"
Although old Samon was shy, he couldn't help but wonder.
When I looked, Detective Akechi was still as he was last night, still peacefully asleep.
"
thank god.
It seems that Twenty Faces was afraid of Detective Akechi and never came.
Thank you, thank you.
"
The old man calmed down and quietly woke up the detective.
"
Teacher, please wake up.
It's already dawn.
"
Akechi immediately woke up and
"
Ah, I fell asleep a lot...
Hahaha...I'm sorry.
Nothing happened, did you?
"
While saying that, it was a big stretch.
"
The detective on duty must be sleepy, too.
Since he's all right now, why don't we give him some food and let him rest in peace?
"
"
I agree.
Please open this door.
”
As instructed, the old man took the key out of his pocket, loosened the lock, and rattled the wooden door open.
However, when I opened the door and took a look inside the room, I was greeted by the old man's mouth.
"
Gah!
"
A chorus of cries burst out.
"
what's wrong
what's wrong
"
Surprised, Akechi stood up and peered into the room.
"
Oh, that, that...
"
The old man, unable to speak, was pointing in the room with a trembling hand, muttering in slurred words.
When I saw it, oh, the old man's surprise was not unreasonable.
All the old masterpieces in the room, whether they were hanging on the walls or in boxes on shelves, seemed to have disappeared.
The guard detective fell on the tatami as if smashed into a wreck.
He is snoring loudly.
"
Let, Sensei, nu, nu, was stolen.
Oh, I, I...
”
Old Samon looked as if he had aged ten years in an instant, and his face was terrifying.
Alas, the impossible has happened again.
The guy called Twenty Faces isn't a human, he's a mysterious ghost.
You can do the impossible with such ease.
Akechi staggered into the room and suddenly kicked the snoring detective around his waist.
It seemed that he was already angry at being outwitted by the thieves.
"
Hey, hey, wake up
I didn't ask you to sleep here.
Look, it's been completely stolen.
"
The detective finally woke up, but he was still in a dreamy state.
"
Uh, uh, what did you steal?
Oh, I'm so sleepy...
Good morning, where is this place?
”
With a half-asleep face, I look around the room restlessly.
"
Stay strong.
Oh, I see.
I think you were hit with an anesthetic.
Think about what happened last night.
"
Akechi grabbed the detective's shoulder and shook him.
"
You're Akechi, aren't you?
Ah, this was Kusakabe's art castle.
Oops.
I was hit.
Yes, it's an anesthetic.
In the middle of the night last night, something like a black shadow crept up behind me.
And then, something soft and foul-smelling covered my nose and mouth.
After that, after that, I was completely clueless.
"
The detective finally woke up and looked apologetically around the empty picture-room.
"
After all, it was.
Well then, the detectives guarding the front and back gates may be facing the same fate.
"
Talking to himself, Akechi ran out of the room, but after a while he heard someone calling out to him in the kitchen.
"
Mr. Kusakabe.
please come here
”
Somehow, the old man and the detective went to where the voice was coming from, and Akechi was standing at the entrance of the manservant's room, pointing inside.
"
I can't see the shadows of detectives at the front gate or the back gate.
That's not all.
I'm sorry, poor fellow.
"
When I looked, I saw that in the corner of the servant's room, Uncle Sakuzo and his wife were lying around, tied up in high-handed gloves and bitten by a gag.
Of course, it is the work of thieves.
She had tied up the two servants so that they would not interfere.
"
Oh my god.
Mr. Akechi, what is this?
”
Old Kusakabe, in a state of frustration, approached Akechi.
It is understandable because the treasure that I valued more than my life disappeared overnight like a dream.
"
No, I have nothing to say.
I didn't know Twenty Faces had such skill.
It was a mistake to underestimate the opponent.
"
"
faux pas?
Akechi-san, you'll get away with making a mistake, but what should I do?
.
”
The old man straightened up, glared at Akechi with bloodshot eyes, and was about to jump at any moment.
Akechi looked down slightly, as if he was apologetic.
The detective is smiling, isn't he?
The laughter spread all over his face, and in the end, he burst into laughter, as if he could not stop laughing.
Old Kusakabe was taken aback.
Was Akechi confused by the toughness of being outwitted by a thief?
"
Akechi-san, what's wrong with you?
I wonder what's wrong with this.
”
"
Hahahaha...that's funny.
Great detective Kogoro Akechi, there is no stumbling block.
It was as easy as twisting a baby's hand, wasn't it?
The guy called Twenty Faces is great.
I respect him.
"
The state of Akechi is finally strange.
"
This, this, Akechi-san, what is wrong with you?
Cheez, what the heck is going on here.
Oh, and it's a pity if Sakuzo and the others are left like this.
Detective, don't be idly, please remove the rope quickly.
Take off the gag.
If that happens, Sakuzo might be able to get clues about the thieves.
”
Since Akechi is completely unreliable, the old man Kusakabe will do something about it like a detective.
"
Here are the old man's orders.
Remove the rope.
”
Akechi gave the detective a strange look.
Then, the detective, who had been absent-minded until then, suddenly stood up and took out a rope from his pocket. I started to hang.
"
What are you doing?
Oh, this guy is always crazy.
What are you going to do with me?
It does not bind me.
Take the two ropes that are lying there.
This is not me.
”
However, the detective is not going to relax his hand at all.
In silence, I finally tied up the old man with high hands and small hands.
"
This is crazy.
What are you doing?
Oh, it hurts, it hurts
Even though it hurts.
Akechi-san, what are you laughing at?
Can you stop me?
This man seems to have gone mad.
Hurry up and tell them to remove the rope.
This is Akechi-san.
"
The old man became confused.
Did they all go crazy together?
Otherwise, there is no law to tie up the client of the case.
How silly is the detective grinning when he sees it again?
"
Who are you calling, old man?
It seems like you were talking about Akechi.
”
Akechi himself said this.
"
What are you talking about?
Akechi-san, you must have forgotten your own name.
”
"
is this me?
Are you saying that I am Kogoro Akechi?
"
Akechi calmed down and finally said something strange.
"
It's decided, isn't it?
What a fool...
"
"
Hahaha... Old man, what's wrong with you?
Akechi doesn't heal people here.
"
When the old man heard that, he opened his mouth wide open and made a face as if he had been bitten by a fox.
I can't even talk to you about it.
"
Old man, have you met Kogoro Akechi before?
"
"
never met.
Well, I know it well by looking at the picture.
”
"
Photo?
I'm a little nervous in the picture.
Are you saying I look like that picture?
"
"
…………
”
"
Old man, you forgot what Twenty Faces was like.
Twenty Faces, you see, he was a master of disguise, wasn't he?
"
"
Well then, you are...
"
The old man finally understood what had happened.
I was horrified and lost my color.
"
Hahaha... do you understand?
"
"
No, no, it can't be that stupid.
I saw the newspaper.
The "Izu Nippo" properly wrote "Akechi Detective Arrives".
Then she told me that the maid at Fujiya was this person.
There should be no mistakes.
”
"
But there was a big mistake.
Because Akechi Kogoro has not yet returned from abroad.
"
"
Newspapers should not lie.
”
"
However, I lied.
One of the reporters in the social affairs department fell for our scheme and handed the editor-in-chief a false manuscript.
"
"
Hmm, then what happened to the detective?
There is no way the police could be fooled by the fake detective Akechi.
”
The old man didn't want to believe that the man standing in front of him was that dreadful twenty-faced man.
I really wanted to make him Kogoro Akechi.
"
Hahaha... old man, are you still thinking about that?
Isn't your blood circulation bad?
Criminal?
Ah, this man, and the two who guarded the front and back gates, hahaha... What, my henchmen were just imitating detectives.
"
The old man couldn't help but believe it, even if he didn't believe it.
The man he thought was Kogoro Akechi turned out to be a great thief, far from being a great detective.
It was the Phantom Thief with Twenty Faces who had feared him.
Oh, what a brilliant idea that the detective was a thief.
Old man Kusakabe asked Twenty Faces to be the keeper of the treasure.
"
Old man, how did the Egyptian tobacco taste last night?
Hahaha... Did you remember?
There was a little drug inside.
I wanted the old man to take a nap while the two detectives went into the room, carried out the luggage, and loaded it into the car.
How did you get into that room?
Hahaha...it doesn't matter.
I should have borrowed a little key from your bosom.
"
Twenty Faces spoke softly, as if he were making small talk.
But from the old man's point of view, his overly polite manner of speaking must have made him even more annoyed.
"
Well then, we are in a hurry, so please excuse us.
Please rest assured that I will take good care of the works of art and keep them in a safe place.
So, goodbye.
"
The twenty-faced man politely bowed, followed by his subordinate disguised as a detective, and left the scene.
The poor old man, yelling something incomprehensible, tried to chase after the thief, but the chopsticks of the rope wrapped all over his body were tied to the pillar there, and he tumbled. I tried to get up, but immediately collapsed.
Then, lying down, he would gnash his teeth and even shed tears, writhing with regret and sorrow.
One afternoon, about half a month after the Bijutsujo Incident, I saw a cute boy in the crowd on the platform of Tokyo Station.
This is none other than Yoshio Kobayashi.
Akechi detective's boy assistant familiar to readers.
Kobayashi-kun is walking up and down the platform in a jumper, wearing a well-matched bird's-eye hat, and tapping his shiny shoes.
In my hand, I hold a piece of newspaper rolled up like a stick.
Readers, there is actually an astonishing article in this newspaper about the Twenty Faces, but I will tell you about it a little later.
Kobayashi boy came to Tokyo station to visit his teacher Kogoro Akechi.
The great detective is really coming back from a foreign country.
Akechi accepts an invitation from a certain country, gets involved in a serious incident, and returns with great success, so to speak, a triumphant general.
Normally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and private organizations should have sent a large number of people, but Akechi was very nervous about such things, and in his profession as a detective, he tried to keep himself out of the public eye as much as possible. I had to, so I purposely didn't notify the public, but just let my home know when I would arrive at Tokyo Station.
Mrs. Akechi always asked to go out, and it became a custom for young Kobayashi to go out.
Kobayashi is staring at his wristwatch.
Five minutes later, Akechi-sensei's long-awaited train arrived.
It's been almost three months since I've seen you.
For some reason, my heart felt excited.
When he suddenly came to his senses, a handsome gentleman approached Kobayashi with a big smile on his face.
He had a warm mouse-colored overcoat, a rattan cane, half-white hair, a half-white moustache, a plump face, and gleaming tortoiseshell glasses.
On the other side, Kobayashi was a complete stranger, even though he was smiling.
"
Isn't Yakimi from Akechi's place?
”
asked the gentleman in a deep, gentle voice.
"
Yes, but...
”
Looking at the dubious face of the boy, the gentleman nodded,
"
My name is Tsujino from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and since I knew that Mr. Akechi was going home on this train, I came to see him unofficially.
I have some confidential matters.
"
I explained.
"
Oh, I see.
My name is Kobayashi, the teacher's assistant.
"
After removing his hat and bowing, Mr. Tsujino's face became even more smiling.
"
Oh, I heard your name
In fact, I remembered seeing your face in a photo that appeared in the newspaper one day, so I called out to you like this.
The one-on-one fight with Twenty Faces was a success.
Your popularity is great.
My children are also big Kobayashi fans.
Hahaha…….
"
And he keeps praising me.
Kobayashi felt a little embarrassed and couldn't help but blush.
"
Speaking of 20 faces, in Shuzenji they use Akechi's name and imitate it quite boldly.
Besides, this morning's newspaper said that they were finally going to visit the National Museum.
It was a disgusting attitude that made a fool of the police.
Never let it go to waste.
I was impatiently waiting for Akechi-san to come back, even just to beat him up.
”
"
Yes, so am I.
I tried my best, but it is far beyond my power.
I waited impatiently, hoping that the teacher would take revenge on me.
"
"
Is the newspaper you have this morning?
"
"
Yes, that's right.
It's a newspaper with a notice to visit the museum.
”
Mr. Kobayashi said so and showed me the part where the article was written.
About half of the social section is filled with articles on twenty faces.
To summarize its meaning, yesterday an express mail from Twenty Faces arrived to the director of the National Museum, and it was truly astonishing to receive all the works of art from the museum's collection. It was because the declaration had been made.
As usual, the date of the thief's death, December 10th, was clearly specified.
Speaking of December 10th, there are only nine days left.
The frightening ambition of the Phantom with Twenty Faces seems to have reached its peak.
Believe it or not, they are going to fight against the nation.
All I've done so far is personal treasure, and it's certainly a shameful act, but it's not unheard of.
But to steal a museum is to steal state property.
Was there ever a single person in the past who planned to be such a sly thief?
A fearsome thief who is neither daring nor reckless.
But when you think about it, how can you do such a ridiculous thing?
Speaking of museums, dozens of officials are packed.
There is also a guard.
There is also a policeman.
What's more, with such a notice, how vigilant might it be?
It is not unavoidable that the whole museum will be surrounded by police officers.
Ah, the Twenty-Faced Face must have been crazy.
Or does he have the confidence to pull off the seemingly impossible?
Is it possible that the devil has schemes beyond the imagination of human wisdom?
Well, enough about Twenty Faces, we have to meet Akechi Detective.
"
Oh, it looks like the train is here.
"
Without Mr. Tsujino's warning, Kobayashi jumped to the edge of the platform.
If you stand in the front row of the people leaving and look to your left, the express train carrying Detective Akechi is getting closer and bigger every moment.
The air quivered, and a black steel box brushed before my eyes.
When the train finally came to a stop with the faces in the windows and the squeak of the brakes, I saw the familiar figure of Akechi-sensei at the doorway of the first-class car.
Dressed in all black—a black suit, a black gauze, and a black soft hat—she had already noticed Kobayashi, and was smiling and beckoning him.
"
Teacher, please go home.
"
Kobayashi was overwhelmed with joy and rushed over to the teacher's side.
Detective Akechi handed over some trunks to Akabo, then went down to the platform and came towards Mr. Kobayashi.
"
Kobayashi-kun, you seem to have had a lot of trouble.
I know all about it from the newspapers.
But I'm glad I did.
"
Ah, it's the teacher's voice I heard for the first time in three months.
Mr. Kobayashi looked at the great detective with a cheerful face, and even closer to him.
Then, out of nowhere, a hand reached out and the teacher and student exchanged a firm handshake.
At that moment, Mr. Tsujino from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs walked up to Akechi, held out a business card with his title, and called out to him.
"
Akechi-san?
As a matter of fact, I had heard from a certain source that you were going home on this train, and I wanted to talk to you in private, so I went out.
"
When Akechi received the business card, he looked at it for a while, as if he was thinking about it, but then suddenly changed his mind and answered cheerfully.
"
Ah, Mr. Tsujino, is that so?
I know your name very well.
To tell the truth, I had planned to return home, change clothes, and then immediately go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was a pity that I had to go out of my way to come.
”
"
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you over tea at the Railway Hotel, but I won't let you.
"
"
Is it a railway hotel?
Whoa, at the Railway Hotel.
”
While staring at Mr. Tsujino's face, Akechi muttered something impressed.
"
Yes, I don't mind at all.
Let's get along.
”
Then he approached Kobayashi, who was waiting a little farther away, and whispered something,
"
Mr. Kobayashi, I decided to go to the hotel with this person, so please put your luggage in the taxi and go home early.
"
I ordered.
"
Yes, I will go ahead.
”
As Kobayashi ran after Red Hat, the great detective and Mr. Tsujino stood shoulder to shoulder and talked with each other as they passed through the underpass to the second floor of Tokyo Station. I went up to the railway hotel.
Presumably preordered, one of the best rooms in the hotel was ready to receive guests, and was reverently waited on by a good-looking head boy.
They sat down in easy chairs at a round table covered with fine fabrics, and as if waiting for them, another boy brought refreshments.
"
You, I have a little secret to talk with you, so please leave your seat.
Don't let anyone in until you ring the bell.
”
When Mr. Tsujino ordered, the head boy bowed and left.
The two of us are facing each other in a closed room.
"
Akechi, how much I wanted to meet Kakimi.
I've been waiting impatiently for a day.
"
Mr. Tsujino smiled so nostalgically, but stared sharply at the other person, and began to speak like this.
Akechi sat down on the cushion of an easy chair and answered with a smile on his face, just like Mr. Tsujino.
"
I really wanted to meet you.
I was just thinking about this in the train.
Maybe you'll come pick me up at the station.
"
"
Way to go.
Then you must know my real name.
"
Mr. Tsujino's nonchalant words were full of terrifying power.
The tip of my left hand resting on the armrest of the chair trembled slightly from the excitement.
"
At least, I knew from the moment I saw that plausible business card that it was not Mr. Tsujino of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
I'm a little embarrassed when you say your real name, but it seems that the newspapers call you the Fiend with Twenty Faces.
”
Akechi calmly spoke these astonishing words.
Oh dear readers, is this really the case?
How can a thief leave a detective?
Is it possible for a detective to do such absurd thing, even knowing it, to be invited to a thief's tea?
"
Akechi, you are exactly as I imagined you to be.
Not even Sherlock Holmes could have known it from the first time he saw me, and yet accepted my invitation.
I'm really fun.
What a life worth living.
Oh, I'm so glad I'm alive for this moment of excitement.
"
Twenty-faced Mr. Tsujino said as if he worshiped detective Akechi.
But you can't be lazy.
He is a great bandit who has made enemies all over the country.
They are embarking on an almost desperate adventure.
There must be enough preparation there.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Tsujino's right hand is in the pocket of his clothes and never comes out of it.
What do you have in your pocket?
"
Hahaha... you seem a little too excited.
To me, this is not at all unusual.
But, Mr. Twenty Faces, I feel a little sorry for you.
Because I'm back, your grand plans have come to naught.
Now that I'm back, I won't let you rub a finger on the art in the museum.
Also, the treasures of the Kusakabe family in Izu will not be your property.
Okay, I promise you this much.
"
Despite all that, Akechi seemed to be enjoying himself.
He puffs the smoke of the cigarette that he has swallowed deeply into his face and smiles.
"
Well then, let me promise.
"
Twenty Faces was not defeated either.
"
The museum's collections will always be stolen on the day of advance notice.
Also, the treasure of the Kusakabe family... hahaha... can that be returned?
Because, Akechi-kun, you were an accomplice in that case, weren't you?
”
"
accomplice?
Oh, I see.
You're very good at speaking.
Hahaha…….
"
The two, the great thief and the great detective, who are filled with bitter animosity and who cannot help but destroy each other, are chatting like good friends.
However, in their hearts, both of them were completely excited.
With such a daring thief, I don't know what kind of preparations he has behind him.
It's not just the thief's pocket pistol that's terrifying.
Even the most peculiar head boy is not necessarily a thief's minion.
Besides that, I don't know how many thieves' minions are in this hotel.
The current position of the two is no different from a kendo master and a master glaring at each other with white blades.
It's a battle of energy and energy.
A hair-like laziness can quickly decide the game.
The two continue to talk more and more amicably.
The face is smiling and smiling.
However, even though it was cold, beads of sweat were forming on Twenty Faces' forehead.
Both of them had their eyes flashing like fire.
The great detective had no reason to catch the thief on the platform.
How could this opportunity have been overlooked?
Readers may be feeling frustrated.
But this speaks to how strong the detective's confidence is.
Only by underestimating thieves can such a stray act be possible.
The detective was confident that the treasure in the museum would not let a thief slip his finger.
I was determined to recover all the treasures of the Art Castle, as well as the countless other stolen items.
For that reason, it would be a disadvantage if we caught the thief now.
Twenty Faces has many minions.
For if the leader were to be captured, one never knew how his subordinates would dispose of the stolen treasure.
It won't be long before the arrest is made even after the location of the prized treasure has been ascertained.
So, rather than disappointing the thief who came all the way, I thought it would be fun to pretend that I was on board with the thief and test out the wisdom of Twenty Faces.
"
Akechi-kun, imagine my current position.
If you want to catch me, you can always do it.
All you have to do is ring the bell over there.
And all you have to do is tell the boy to call the police.
Hahaha... what a wonderful adventure.
Do you know this feeling?
It's life-threatening.
Right now, I'm standing on top of a precipice that's dozens of meters tall.
”
Twenty faces is just fearless.
At the same time, he narrowed his eyes, stared into the detective's face, and began to laugh out loud in a funny way.
"
Hahaha…….
"
Kogoro Akechi also laughed as hard as he could.
"
You shouldn't be so nervous about anything.
Knowing your true identity, I've made it this far, but now I have no intention of capturing you.
I just wanted to have a little chat with the famous Twenty Faces.
You know, there's no rush to catch you.
There are still nine days until the museum raid.
Well, I'm going to take it easy and see your waste of effort.
"
"
Ah, as expected of a great detective.
You're fat.
I've fallen in love with you...
By the way, if you don't get me, it looks like I'm going to get you hooked.
"
Twenty Faces gradually raised the tone of his voice and grinned awkwardly.
"
Akechi-kun, aren't you scared?
Or do you think I brought you here for nothing?
You think I'm not ready for anything?
If I were to shut up and let you out of this room, wouldn't you be misunderstanding me?
"
"
Come on, I don't know.
No matter how much you say you won't pay, of course I'll leave here.
Now I have to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It's because I'm busy.
”
Akechi nodded, slowly getting up and walking in the opposite direction of the door.
Then, as if gazing at the scenery, he looked carefree through the glass window, yawned lightly, took out a handkerchief, and wiped his face.
At that moment, when I rang the bell, the first head boy and another boy, who was equally as smart, opened the door and entered.
Then, in front of the table, I took an upright and unmoving posture.
"
Hey, hey, Akechi-kun, you don't seem to know my power yet.
I think they feel safe here because it's a railway hotel.
But you, for example, like this.
"
Twenty Faces said so and turned to the two big boys.
"
You guys, say hello to Akechi-sensei.
”
Then, the two men instantly became like two wild beasts and rushed towards Akechi.
"
Wait, what are you going to do with me?
”
Akechi pulled himself up with his back to the window.
"
Don't you understand?
Look at your feet.
You have a trunk that is a little too big for my luggage.
It's empty inside.
I mean, it's your coffin.
These two boys are going to bury you in that trunk now.
Hahaha…….
Even the great detective was a bit surprised.
It was a little surprising that one of my subordinates would infiltrate the hotel boy.
No, my dear, it's no use yelling.
Both yells are my rented rooms.
And just to make sure, I'm not the only two men here.
There are guards in the corridors to keep you out of the way.
"
Oh, what a blunder!
The great detective has fallen into the enemy's trap.
It's like jumping into the fire knowing that.
With such preparation, there is no escape.
It's about Twenty Faces, who dislikes blood, so I don't think he would take his life, but Kogoro Akechi is more of a hindrance to thieves than the police.
The idea must be to lock it in a trunk, take it to some obscure place, and hold it captive until the museum raid is over.
The two big men approached Akechi, thinking it would be futile, but they were hesitant to jump on him at any moment.
I was struck by the power of a great detective.
However, in terms of strength, he is one in two, no, one in three, so no matter how strong Kogoro Akechi is, there is no match.
Oh, he's going to return home sooner or later.
Oh, is it really so?
But look, our great detective, in this crisis, still keeps that radiant smile on his face.
And that smile gradually collapses into a funny, irresistible smile.
"
Hahaha…….
"
Laughed off, the two boys froze, their mouths open as if they had been caught by a fox.
"
Akechi-kun, don't be so picky.
what's wrong
Or were you confused by the horror?
"
Twenty Faces couldn't figure out what the other person was really thinking, so he had no choice but to swear.
"
No, you're serious, you're serious.
But hey, come here.
And look out the window.
Because I can see strange things.
"
"
What do you see?
Aren't those just platform roofs?
Even Akechi Kogoro would have been foolish to say something strange and try to get away with it.
”
The thief, however, was somewhat apprehensive and could not help but approach the window.
"
Hahaha... Of course, it's all about the roof.
But there's something strange on the other side of that roof.
Look, it's over here.
"
Akechi pointed,
"
Between the roofs, you can see something black crouching on the platform.
You look like a child.
You're staring at this window with a small telescope, aren't you?
That kid looks kind of familiar.
”
Readers, I am sure you have already guessed who it is.
that's right.
As you can guess, I'm Akechi Detective's excellent assistant Kobayashi Shonen.
Mr. Kobayashi looks out of the hotel window with one of the seven tools, a fountain pen-shaped telescope, and seems to be waiting for something to happen.
"
Oh, it's Kobayashi's boy.
So he didn't go home?
"
"
that's right.
I asked at the hotel entrance which room I was in, and told him to look carefully at the window of that room.
”
However, the thief still had no idea what it meant.
"
So what are you going to do?
”
Twenty Faces grew more and more uneasy, but with a frightening sigh, he crouched at Akechi.
"
Look at this.
look at my hand
If you do something wrong with me, this handkerchief will flutter out the window.
"
When I looked, Akechi's right wrist was sticking out from the bottom of the slightly opened window, and a pure white handkerchief was pinched between his fingertips.
"
This is Aizuna.
Then the kid runs into the station office.
Then the phone bell rings.
And don't you think five minutes would be enough until the police rushed in and secured the hotel doorway?
I think I have the power to resist the three of you in five or ten minutes.
Hahaha... how about you open this finger and you'll be able to see the wonderful big scene of the arrest of Twenty Faces?
”
Comparing Akechi's handkerchief sticking out of the window and Kobayashi's boy on the platform, the thief pondered for a while, but in the end he seemed to have realized that he was at a disadvantage. It was said to soften.
"
And if I take my hand and send you home, I'm sure you won't drop the handkerchief.
In other words, it's an exchange between your freedom and my freedom.
"
"
Of course.
As I said earlier, I don't have the slightest idea of ​​what to do with you right now.
If you're going to catch it, you don't need this roundabout handkerchief.
I will have Kobayashi-kun report it to the police immediately.
If so, you should be in a police cage by now.
Hahaha…….
”
"
But aren't you a strange man too?
Do you want to get away from me after that?
"
"
Hmm, I feel like it's a little weird to take it easy now.
Someday, when I capture you, I intend to obtain all of your subordinates and the many hidden works of art in one fell swoop.
Maybe I'm being a little too greedy.
Hahaha…….
"
For a long time Twenty Faces remained silent, biting his lip, but then, as if he had changed his mind, he burst into laughter.
"
As expected of Kogoro Akechi.
It shouldn't happen....
Maa don't be offended.
I just tried to get your attention.
I'm not serious.
Well, today, I'm going to send you to the front door as a farewell.
”
But the detective wasn't so kind-hearted as to give up on such a loose talk.
"
It's nice to say goodbye
These boys are a little annoying.
First of all, I'd like you to drive these two, and then your companions in the hallway, into the kitchen.
”
The thief made no objections, immediately ordered the boys to stand up, and widened the entrance door so that the corridor could be seen through.
"
Is this okay?
Look, you can hear their footsteps coming down the stairs.
"
Akechi finally left the window and put the handkerchief in his pocket.
There is no way that all the railway hotels are being occupied by bandits, so once you've stepped out into the hallway, you're all set.
There seemed to be guests in a room a little farther away, and there were real boys who weren't bandits' men walking down the corridor.
The two of them walked shoulder to shoulder, as if they were close friends, to the front of the elevator.
The entrance to the elevator was left open, and a uniformed elevator boy of about twenty was standing waiting for someone.
Akechi casually stepped into it, but
"
Oh, I forgot my walking stick.
Please get off first.
"
Just when Twenty Faces said that, suddenly the iron door rattled and the elevator began to descend.
"
It's strange.
"
Akechi quickly realized this.
However, he was staring at the hand of the elevator boy, not panicking.
Then, as expected, the elevator suddenly stopped running as it descended to a place surrounded by walls on all four sides, halfway between the first and second floors.
"
What happened.
"
"
excuse me.
It seems that the machine has broken down.
please wait a moment.
I'll get back to you soon.
"
The boy was apologetically fumbling around with the driver's steering wheel.
"
what are you doing
Come on.
"
Akechi sharply grabbed the boy by the neck and pulled him back.
It was such a force that the boy involuntarily fell to his knees in the corner of the elevator.
"
You can't cheat.
You think I don't know how to operate an elevator?
"
After scolding you, what happens when you turn the handle with a click?
The elevator began to descend effortlessly, didn't it?
When he got downstairs, Akechi, still gripping the steering wheel, glared at the boy's face, who was still on his buttocks.
The fear of that glare.
The young boy trembled and involuntarily held his right pocket above it as if he were carrying something important.
The agile detective didn't miss the look and hand movements.
I suddenly jumped on it, put my hand in the pocket I was holding, and took out a single bill.
It is a 1,000 yen bill.
The elevator boy had been bribed with a 1,000-yen bill for Twenty Faces' subordinates.
The thief then kept the detective locked up in the elevator for five or ten minutes, and then tried to sneak down the stairs.
Even the fearless Twenty-Faced Man did not dare to walk side-by-side with the detective through the hallway swarming with hoteliers and guests, now that he had already figured out what he was.
Akechi says he will never catch it, but as a thief, I can't trust his words.
The great detective jumped out of the elevator and ran down the corridor to the front door.
Then, just in time, Mr. Tsujino, who had 20 faces, was walking smoothly down the front stone steps.
"
Oh, sorry, sorry, there was a problem with the elevator, so I was late.
”
Akechi patted Mr. Tsujino's shoulder from behind, still smiling.
Turning around and seeing Akechi, there was no mention of Mr. Tsujino's face.
The thieves were convinced that the elevator's scheme would succeed.
It was not unreasonable to be so surprised that my complexion changed.
"
Hahaha... What's wrong with you, Tsujino-san, you look a little pale.
Oh, and this, the elevator boy asked me to give it to you.
The boy said he was too bad and knew how to operate the elevator, so I couldn't keep him for long.
Don't blame me.
Hahaha…….
”
Akechi laughed aloud and flicked the 1,000-yen bill two or three times in front of Twenty Faces, then held it in the other person's hand.
"
So, goodbye.
Someday soon.
”
Then, suddenly, he turned around and walked away without looking back.
With the 1,000-yen bill still in his hand, Mr. Tsujino was taken aback and looked away at the figure behind the great detective.
"
Check.
"
I said annoyedly, and called the car that had been waiting there.
In this way, the first encounter between the great detective and the great thief was a brilliant victory for the detective.
From a thief's point of view, he could have been caught whenever he wanted to, but since he had been overlooked, there is no greater shame than the name of Twenty Faces.
"
I'm sure I'll do this trick.
”
He clenched his fist at Akechi's back and couldn't help but murmur curse words.
"
Ah, Akechi-san, I was just about to ask you.
Where are you?
”
Detective Akechi had walked fifty meters from the railway hotel when he was suddenly stopped and had to stop.
"
Oh, Mr. Imanishi.
"
It was Detective Imanishi, who works for the Metropolitan Police Department's Investigation Division.
"
Leaving aside the greetings, what happened to the man who calls himself Tsujino?
I'm sorry that I escaped and ended up.
”
"
How do you know that?
"
"
I found Kobayashi doing strange things on the platform.
That kid is really stubborn.
No matter how much I ask, they won't tell me.
However, I changed hands and finally confessed.
I remember that you entered the railway hotel with a man named Tsujino from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and that Tsujino was apparently disguised as Twenty Faces.
I immediately called the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but Mr. Tsujino was in the Ministry.
It must be a fake.
That's why I came here to support you.
"
"
I'm sorry about that, but that man has already left.
”
"
Eh, did you go home?
So that guy wasn't Twenty Faces?
"
"
It was twenty faces.
He's a very funny man.
"
"
Akechi-san, Akechi-san, what are you talking about?
Are you saying that you let him go without informing the police even though you knew he was twenty-faced?
”
Detective Imanishi was so overwhelmed that he wanted to question Detective Akechi's sanity.
"
I have an idea.
”
Akechi answers honestly.
"
It would be embarrassing for you, as an individual, to make such a decision just because you have an idea.
In any case, there is no way to escape even if you know it's a bandit.
It's my duty to keep track of him.
Where did he go?
It would be an automobile.
”
The detective is resentful of the private investigator's lone treatment.
"
If you choose to pursue it, feel free to do so, but it will probably be in vain.
"
"
I will not accept your order.
I will go to the hotel and look up the car number and make arrangements.
”
"
Oh, if it's a car number, I know it without going to the hotel.
It's number 13887.
"
"
Well, do you even know the car number?
And do you not even try to follow me?
”
The detective was taken aback again, but he could not keep up with the useless questioning when the time was running out.
After writing down the number in my notebook, I ran to the police box in front of me.
The news was immediately reported to each police station and police box in Tokyo by telephone.
"
Take the number 13887.
Mr. Tsujino of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is riding in that car.
"
How this order thrilled the hearts of police officers throughout Tokyo.
It goes without saying that the police officers at the police box waited with their eyes open and their hands stretched out, hoping that I would grab the car and have the honor of apprehending the thief.
Twenty minutes after the phantom thief had left the hotel, a policeman working at a police box in Totsuka-cho, Shinjuku Ward was fortunate enough to find the car numbered 13887.
It was a young and courageous policeman, but when he glanced at a car that was running like an arrow past the police box at a speed faster than the regulation, he saw that the number was 1388. It was number seven.
The young policeman was taken aback and involuntarily played a warrior.
Then, as soon as I stopped the empty car that was running after that, I jumped,
"
That car, that car has the famous Twenty Faces on it.
run
It doesn't matter how much speed you put out, run until the engine explodes.
”
I cried out.
Luckily, the driver of the car was also a kind young man.
The car is new and the engine is perfect.
Run, run, it started running like a bullet.
The two cars galloping like devils could not help but stare at the passers-by.
Looking around, I saw a policeman sitting in the car behind me, staring intently ahead and yelling.
"
It's a catch, it's a catch!
”
Yaji horse screams and runs with the car.
The dog barks along with it.
It is a commotion that all the walking crowds stop.
But the car leaves those sights behind and just flies on and on like a passerby.
It must have overtaken several cars.
How many times did you nearly get hit by a car and barely dodge?
Since you can't go fast on narrow roads, the thief's car turned to the Great Ring Road and began to run at full speed in the direction of the Prince.
The thief is of course aware of the pursuit.
But nothing can be done.
In broad daylight in the city, jumping out of a car and hiding yourself is no trick.
When I passed Ikebukuro, I heard a loud bang from the car in front of me.
Ah, did the thief finally get impatient and take out that pocket pistol?
No, no, it wasn't.
Not a western gangster movie.
In the bustling city, even if you look at it with a pistol, it's not something you can escape now.
It wasn't a pistol, it was a flat tire.
A thief's luck came.
Even so, I continued to drive for a while, but before I knew it, my speed slowed down, and I was overtaken by the policeman's car.
I can't do anything anymore if the car is laid on my way to escape.
Both cars stopped.
In an instant, a crowd of people from Kuroyama surrounded it.
Before long, a nearby policeman will come running.
Oh dear readers, Mr. Tsujino has finally caught on.
"
Twenty faces, twenty faces!
”
Without a word, a voice arose in the crowd.
The thief was surrounded by two police officers who rushed over from the vicinity, and a young police officer from the Totsuka police box.
"
Twenty Faces Caught!
"
"
How impertinent they are.
”
"
But that policeman is great.
"
"
Good morning policeman.
"
Amidst the cheers that erupt in the crowd, the policeman and the thief rush to the Metropolitan Police Department in the chasing car.
Because it is too big to be detained in the police station of jurisdiction.
When we arrived at the Metropolitan Police Department and found out what had happened, the police erupted in cheers.
How unexpectedly the thief who was struggling was caught!
It is said that this is thanks to Detective Imanishi's agile handling and the brave efforts of the young police officers of the Totsuka police station, so the two are extremely popular.
Chief Investigator Nakamura was more than happy to hear this report.
This is because the section chief could not forget the resentment that he had been successfully outmaneuvered because of the robbers during the Hashiba family incident.
In the investigation room, a serious investigation began immediately.
The other party is a master of disguise, so no one knows his face.
First and foremost, I had to summon a witness to make sure it wasn't the wrong person.
A phone call was made to Kogoro Akechi's home.
However, just at that time, the great detective went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was busy, so it was decided that Kobayashi would appear instead.
Before long, a cute little Kobayashi boy with cheeks like apples appeared in the stern examination room.
As soon as he saw the thief at first sight, he testified that it must be that person who assumed the pseudonym Mr. Tsujino of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"
It was this person.
It must be this person.
”
Mr. Kobayashi answered clearly.
"
Hahaha... I don't know, you must rely on your child's eyesight.
No matter how hard you try to escape, it's no use.
You must be Twenty Faces.
"
Chief Nakamura couldn't help but be overjoyed when he thought he had finally caught the enviable phantom thief.
As if triumphant, he said this and glared squarely at the thief.
"
However, it is different.
This guy is in trouble.
I had no idea he was the famous Twenty Faces.
"
The thief, disguised as a gentleman, seems to be trying to fool around, and says strange things.
"
What did you say?
I don't understand what you're saying at all.
”
"
I don't understand either.
Then he disguised himself as me and used me as a double.
"
"
Hey, come on, just take it easy.
No matter how stupid I am, I can't get on that hand anymore.
”
"
No, it's not.
Well, calm down and listen to my explanation.
I am like this.
It's definitely not Twenty Faces.
"
As the gentleman said so, as if he had just remembered, he pulled out his business card holder from his pocket and held out a business card.
It says "Matsushita Shobei" and has the address of an apartment in Suginami Ward printed on it.
"
As you can see, I'm Matsushita, and I've had a bit of a failure in business, and now I'm unemployed, and I live alone in an apartment.
It was yesterday.
While wandering around Hibiya Park, I met a man who looked like an office worker.
The man told me that he was making a lot of money.
In other words, if I could get in a car for the day and drive around Tokyo according to the man's instructions, I would pay him 5,000 yen on top of the cost of the car.
Sounds good, doesn't it?
I'm dressed like this, but I'm unemployed, so I wanted a handout of 5,000 yen.
The man said that there was some circumstance involved in this, and he started talking to me, but I stopped him, saying that I didn't have to ask him about the situation, so I agreed. It's gone.
So, I've been driving around in my car since morning today.
In the afternoon, I was asked to eat at the railroad hotel.
They asked me to wait here for a while, so I parked the car in front of the hotel and sat in it waiting. came out of the railway hotel, opened my car, and entered.
When I first saw the man, I was astonished.
I almost thought I had lost my mind.
This is because the man who entered my car looked exactly like me, from his face to his suit, from his toe to his cane.
It was a strange feeling, like I was looking at myself in a mirror.
If you look at it in astonishment, isn't it getting more and more amazing?
The man walked into my car, then opened the door on the other side and went out.
In other words, the gentleman who looked exactly like me just passed the passenger seat of the car.
Then the man said something strange as he passed me.
'Let's leave now.
It doesn't matter where.
I run at full speed.
’ With that said, I hid, you know, in the barber shop in the basement in front of the railway hotel.
My car was parked right in front of the basement entrance.
I thought it was strange, but since they promised to do as they please, I immediately told the driver to drive at full speed.
Then, I can't remember exactly how I ran, but behind Waseda University, I noticed a car chasing me.
I don't know what it is, but I'm terrified.
I yelled at the driver to run.
After that, you know.
When I asked about the story, I was attracted to the key money of only 5,000 yen, and it was used as a substitute for the guy with 20 faces.
No, no, it's not a substitute.
I am the real one, and he is my double.
They imitated my face and clothes, as if they had taken a picture of me.
That's what I'm talking about.
Just like this.
I am a true Matsushita Shobei.
I am the real one and he is the fake.
Do you understand now?
"
Mr. Matsushita said so and thrust his face forward, pulling the hair on his head with all his might and pinching his cheeks.
Oh my God!
Chief Nakamura was once again successfully detained for the sake of the bandits.
The joy of apprehending the thugs with the help of the Metropolitan Police Department ended in disappointment.
Later, when I called the owner of Mr. Matsushita's apartment to check it out, he confirmed that Mr. Matsushita was not at all a suspicious person.
But what about the cautiousness of Twenty Faces?
In order to attack Detective Akechi at Tokyo Station, this much was prepared.
He made his subordinates live in the airport hotel boy, had the elevator attendant on his side, and even called this gentleman, Matsushita, a double-breasted gentleman, to prepare for his escape.
Even if it was called a double, there was no need to search around for someone who looked like him, as far as Twenty Faces was concerned.
After all, he's a terrifying master of disguise.
There is no reason because I will be disguised as any person I can get my hands on.
It doesn't matter who the opponent is.
All I had to do was find a good-natured person who would take my word for it.
Come to think of it, this unemployed gentleman named Matsushita must have been a nice, carefree man.
Kogoro Akechi's house was located in the quiet Yashiki-cho, Ryudo-cho, Minato-ku.
The great detective lives a simple life with his young and beautiful Mrs. Fumiyo, his assistant boy Kobayashi, and one maid.
It was already evening when Detective Akechi returned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a friend's house. I went in and reported the Twenty Faces double-acting incident.
"
I thought that was probably the case.
However, it was annoying to Mr. Nakamura.
"
The great detective said with a smile.
"
Teacher, there is something I don't understand.
"
Kobayashi was always in the habit of asking questions as soon as possible.
"
I understand why Sensei let Twenty Faces escape on purpose, but why didn't he let me follow him back then?
I think it would be a problem if we didn't know what he was hiding in order to prevent the theft of the museum.
”
Detective Akechi listened to Kobayashi's accusations with a happy smile.
"
That's right.
Twenty Faces will let me know.
Do you know why?
Earlier at the hotel, I humiliated him enough.
You can't imagine what a terrible insult it would be to let a detective let such a thief go without even trying to catch him.
Twenty Faces is so depressed that he wants to kill me just for that one thing.
On top of that, they can't do their job as well as they thought they would with me, so I'm sure they'll think of ways to get rid of the people who get in the way of me.
Look out the window.
Look, there will be a kamishibai shop tomorrow.
Even if a picture-story show were to be unloaded in such a lonely place, there was no way it would turn out to be a business. I'm here
"
When Mr. Kobayashi looked at the narrow road in front of the gate of Akechi's residence, he saw a lone picture-story show stand with a dubious appearance.
"
Then he's a subordinate of Twenty Faces.
You're here to find out what your teacher is up to.
”
"
that's right.
Look at that.
Even if you don't have to struggle to find it, the other party will approach you properly.
If you follow him, you'll naturally find out what Twenty Faces is hiding.
"
"
Shall I change my appearance and follow him?
"
Mr. Kobayashi is quick-tempered.
"
No, you don't have to do that.
I have some ideas.
The other person is, after all, a terribly smart guy, so you can't do it carelessly.
By the way, Mr. Kobayashi, some strange things may happen to me tomorrow.
But don't be surprised.
I will never be outwitted by Twenty Faces.
Even if something seems dangerous to me, it's just a ruse, so don't worry.
Mind you.
"
When Kobayashi was told not to do so, he couldn't help but worry.
"
Teacher, if something is dangerous, please let me do it.
It would be great if something happened to the teacher.
”
"
Thank you.
"
Detective Akechi put a warm hand on the boy's shoulder and said,
"
But it's a job you can't do.
Well, trust me.
You know that too.
Have I ever failed...
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
"
Well, it was the evening of the following day.
In front of Detective Akechi's gate, where a picture-story show was standing yesterday, a beggar sat down and bowed to the occasional passerby, mumbling something to himself.
She was wearing a tattered, patched, ragged kimono, sitting on a mat, shivering coldly. Arisa looks pitiful.
Strangely enough, however, when the traffic stopped, the beggar's demeanor changed completely.
He lifted his neck, which had been hanging low until now, and stared at the house of detective Akechi in front of him, with a keen eye shining through his stubble.
Detective Akechi had gone somewhere that morning, but when he returned home about three hours later, whether he knew it or not, he found such a beggar staring at him from the street on the second floor facing the front. In my study, sitting at my desk, I am constantly writing something.
Because the position is right next to the window, Akechi's every move can be seen from the beggar's point of view.
For several hours until evening, the beggar sat comfortably on the ground.
Detective Akechi continued to face his desk, which he could clearly see through the window.
There were no visitors all afternoon, but in the evening a strange figure entered the low stone gate of the Akechi residence.
The man had long hair, a stubble that covered his face, a messy suit, worn directly over a knitted shirt, and a bird's-eye hat with no visible fringes. I'm here.
A vagrant, or rather a lumpen, he looked like a faint-looking fellow, but after a while after he entered the gate, a terrifying yell suddenly leaked out from inside the gate.
"
Hey, Akechi, don't forget to look at my face.
I came here to say thank you.
Now open that door.
I went inside my house and slowly thanked you and my wife.
What do you mean, is there anything for me?
Even if you don't need it over there, you'll find it here for Untokosa.
Get out of there.
Oh my, I'm going to your house.
”
It seems that Akechi himself is out on the porch of the Western-style building to attend to him, but I can't hear Akechi's voice.
Only the vagrant's voice echoes outside the gate.
Hearing this, the beggar who was sitting in the street jumped up and looked around, then crept up to the stone gate and began to look inside from behind the telephone pole.
Looking up, Kogoro Akechi was standing on the front porch, and a vagrant who had put one foot on the stone steps of the porch was shaking his fist in front of Akechi's face and yelling.
Akechi looked at the vagrant quietly, without taking the slightest step forward, but perhaps he could no longer endure the increasingly insults.
"
Idiot.
I don't want to say it's useless.
Get out.
"
I thought he was going to shout, and then he suddenly jumped at the vagrant.
The man who was knocked off stumbled and staggered, but he responded with a jerk and was already desperate.
"
Unu!
"
I'm going to go to the middle of the day, and I'm going to go to the akechi.
However, when it comes to wrestling, even a vagrant can't compete with Detective Akechi, who is a 3rd dan judo.
In an instant, my arm was twisted and I was thrown onto the paving stones under the porch.
For a while, the man seemed unable to move because of the pain, but when he finally got up, the porch door was closed and Akechi was no longer in sight. .
The vagrant went up to the porch and clattered the door, but it seemed to be closed from the inside, and it wouldn't move.
"
Damn it, don't remember.
”
The man finally gave up and came out of the gate while muttering curse words in his mouth.
The beggar, who had seen everything from the beginning, let the vagrant pass by and followed him quietly, but when he was a little far from the Akechi residence, suddenly,
"
Hey, you.
"
called out to the man.
"
Eh.
”
Surprised, he turned around and saw a dirty beggar standing there.
"
What are you doing?
Oh my God, I'm not rich enough to give gifts.
"
The vagrant leaves and tries to get up.
"
No, it's not like that.
I want to ask you something.
”
"
What did you say?
"
The beggar had a strange way of speaking, so the man looked into the beggar's face questioningly.
"
Despite my appearance, I am not a real beggar.
Actually, it's you, so I'll tell you.
I'm a minion of Twenty Faces.
Since this morning, I've been watching Akechi's bastard.
However, you seem to have a lot of animosity towards Akechi.
"
Ah, after all, the beggar was one of Twenty Faces' subordinates.
"
Far from being resentful, my dear, I was sent to prison because of him.
Somehow, I want to return this resentment.
"
The vagrant waved his fist again and became indignant.
"
What is your name?
”
"
Akai Torazo.
"
"
Where are you from?
”
"
I don't know what a parent is.
Stand alone.
”
"
Huh, yes.
"
The beggar thought about it for a while, and finally, what he was thinking, he started out like this.
"
Do you know the name of the boss, Twenty Faces?
”
"
I hear you.
That's amazing!
"
"
Far from being amazing, it's like a wizard.
This time, they're trying to completely steal the museum's National Treasure...
By the way, to the boss of Twenty Faces, this Kogoro Akechi is nothing more than an enemy.
I'm in the same position as you, who has a grudge against Akechi.
Are you willing to become Twenty Faces boss' underling?
That's right, I'm going to return my anger.
”
Hearing this, Torazo Akai stared intently at the beggar's face.
"
Alright, I decided on that.
Brother, why don't you bring one to that twenty-faced boss?
"
And he wanted to become an apprentice.
"
Hmmm, even if it's hilarious.
If you have such a grudge against Akechi, the boss will surely be pleased.
But before that, why don't you make a gift for your boss?
It's also a job to kidnap Akechi's bastard.
”
The man with twenty faces in beggar clothes looked around and said in a low voice.
"
Yeah, what the fuck, kidnapping that bastard, that guy is hilarious.
You can't ask for it.
Give me your hand.
Please help me out.
And when did that happen?
"
Torazo Akai is already frustrated and asks.
"
It's tonight
"
"
Eh, eh, even tonight.
It's going to be nice tomorrow.
But why are you trying to get rid of it?
"
"
That is, after all, the boss of Twenty Faces, he devised a clever method.
For there is a wonderful and beautiful woman among his minions.
I made her the wife of some young man, and sent a detective to come up with an intricate case that would please Akechi.
Then, I told him to check out the house immediately and put him in the car and took him out.
I'm with that woman.
Of course, the driver of the car is also one of my friends.
This guy is a big fan of difficult cases.
Besides, since you're a fragile woman, I'm sure you'll get caught up in this plan.
As for our job, we're just going around the Aoyama Cemetery ahead and waiting for the car carrying Akechi to arrive.
The route is arranged so that it must pass through Asuko.
The car stopped just in front of us waiting.
Then, I and you both opened the door and rushed into the car, immobilizing Akechi and giving him an anesthetic.
The anesthetic is also properly prepared here.
Also, I have two pistols.
Because another friend is supposed to come.
But I don't care.
He doesn't have any animosity towards Akechi, so I'll let you go.
Here's the pistol.
"
The man disguised as a beggar said so, took out a pistol from the bosom of his torn kimono, and handed it to Akai.
"
I've never met something like this before.
What should I do?
”
"
Well, bullets don't go in.
All you have to do is put your finger on the trigger and make it look like it's falling.
The boss of Twenty Faces is a big killer.
This pistol is just scary.
"
Hearing that there were no bullets in it, Akai looked dissatisfied, but put it in his pocket anyway.
"
Well then, let's go to Aoyama Cemetery right away.
"
I nodded.
"
No, it's still too early.
It's a seven-thirty promise.
It may take a little longer than that.
We still have two hours left.
Let's eat somewhere and go out slowly.
"
The beggar said, unwrapping the old-fashioned furoshiki wrapping he was carrying under his arm, took out a bell cloak from inside, and put it on over his torn kimono.
The two of them finished their meal at a nearby cheap restaurant, and when they arrived at Aoyama Cemetery, it was completely dark, and apart from the sparse streetlights, it was a real darkness, a ghostly loneliness.
The Promised Place is the loneliest side street in the cemetery, in the dark where cars seldom pass even at night.
They sat on the bank of the darkness and waited patiently for the time to come.
"
late.
First of all, it's unbearably cold when I'm like this.
”
"
No, it's coming soon.
I just looked at the clock in the shop near the entrance to the cemetery and it was 7:20.
It's been more than ten minutes since then, so it's time to come.
"
After waiting for about ten minutes, we finally began to see the headlights of a car over there.
"
Hey, here we come.
Come on, that must be it.
I'll do my best.
"
As expected, the car came to a stop with a squeak of brakes when they were waiting.
"
sole.
”
With that said, the two suddenly jumped out of the darkness.
"
You go that way.
"
"
Good
”
The two black shadows rushed to the doors on either side of the audience at once.
Then, suddenly, he opened the door with a bang and pointed the pistol barrel at the person in the audience.
At the same time, the Western-dressed lady in the audience was also armed with a pistol.
Then, even the driver was turned backwards, with a pistol shining in his hand.
In other words, four pistols, all aligned, were aimed at a single person in the audience.
The target was, well, Detective Akechi.
Did the detective follow Twenty Faces' predictions and fall for the scheme?
"
If you move, you'll blow me away.
"
Someone yelled at him with a terrifying scare.
Akechi, however, resigned himself to it, quietly leaning back on the cushion, showing no sign of resistance.
He's so quiet that even the thieves think it's strange.
"
Beat it!
"
A low but powerful voice rang out, and the man disguised as a beggar and Torazo Akai rushed into the car with frightening force.
And while Akai was hugging Akechi's upper body, the other one took something like a white cloth from his bosom and quickly pressed it into the detective's mouth, making him relax for a while. I did.
After a little more than five minutes, when the man let go of his hand, even the best detective was no match for drugs.
I was completely exhausted, like a dead man.
"
Hohoho, it's fragile.
”
A Western-dressed woman who was riding with me laughed with a beautiful voice.
"
Hey, it's a rope.
Get out the rope quickly.
"
The man disguised as a beggar receives a string of ropes from the driver, and with the help of Akai, Detective Akechi's hands and feet are tied up so that even if he is revived, he will not be able to move. I was.
"
Come on, okay.
At this rate, even a great detective would be useless.
Now we can finally do our work without worrying about anything.
Hey, my parents are waiting for me.
Hurry up.
”
Akechi's wrapped body was rolled on the floor of the car, and when the beggar and Akai sat down in the audience seats, the car suddenly started running.
The destination is the well-known Nest of Twenty Faces.
A car carrying a beautiful thief, a beggar, Torazo Akai, and Kogoro Akechi, who has lost his mind, picks a lonely town and runs for a run, eventually passing the Meiji Jingu Shrine in Yoyogi. After a while, I stopped in front of the gate of a house standing alone in a dark thicket.
It was a middle-class house of about seven or eight ken, and the nameplate of Juro Kitagawa hung on the pillar of the gate.
The whole house seems to have fallen asleep, and the windows don't let in any light, and it looks like a humble home.
The driver (of course, one of the bandits' subordinates) was the first to get out of the car, and when he called the gate, he heard a bang, and a small peephole in the door opened. A gap opened, and two large eyeballs appeared there.
In the light of the gate lamp, it looks very bright.
"
Oh, how are you doing?
"
asked the eyeball in a whisper.
"
Hmm, it worked.
Please open it quickly.
"
When the driver answered, the door of the gate opened for the first time.
When he looked inside the gate, the bandit's subordinates dressed in black were standing in their way, arrogantly guarding themselves.
The beggar and Torazo Akai, carrying the worn out body of Detective Akechi, disappeared into the gate with the beautiful lady helping him, and the door was closed again.
The lone driver jumped into the empty car.
Then the car started running like an arrow and disappeared in an instant.
There must be a thief's garage somewhere else.
Inside the gate, three subordinates with Akechi in their arms stood in front of the entrance door, and suddenly the electric light in the eaves flashed.
A dazzlingly bright light.
Torazo Akai, who was visiting this house for the first time, was startled by the brightness, but that was not the only thing that surprised him.
Just when I thought the lights were on, out of nowhere, I heard a loud voice.
There was no one around, but voices rang out like ghosts from the air.
"
It seems that the number of people has increased.
Who is he?
”
It's a strange sound that doesn't seem like a human voice.
Akai, a newcomer, looks around restlessly.
Then, a subordinate disguised as a beggar approached the entrance pillar and put his mouth on the part where the pillar was.
"
A new friend.
He is a man who has a deep grudge against Akechi.
You can trust him enough.
”
and talked to himself.
It's like you're on the phone.
"
Yes, then you are welcome to enter.
"
Another strange voice sounded, and the door opened silently, as if by an automatic device.
"
Hahaha……, you were surprised.
I just talked to the leader in the back.
A loudspeaker and a microphone are attached to the shadow of this pillar to keep it out of sight.
Because the president is a cautious person.
"
A subordinate disguised as a beggar told me.
"
But how did you know I was here?
”
Akai has not recovered yet.
"
Hmm, now I know that too.
"
I don't care about the other person, I carry Akechi and enter the Gungun family.
Naturally, Akai also had to follow suit.
Another handsome man was standing in the hallway, looking at them, and he smiled and nodded his head.
I opened the fusuma, went out into the corridor, and arrived at the furthest room, but strangely enough, it was an empty room of ten tatami mats, and the leader was nowhere to be seen.
When the beggar did something with his chin, a beautiful subordinate came closer to the alcove and put his hand on the back of the alcove and did something.
Then what do you think?
Just when I heard a loud bang, a tatami mat in the middle of the room slid down, leaving a black, rectangular hole behind.
"
Come down the ladder here.
”
If you look into the hole, you'll find that there's a really nice wooden staircase.
Oh, what caution!
Even after passing through the front gate checkpoint and the entrance checkpoint, those who do not know how to turn the tatami mats have no idea where the leader is.
"
What are you blanking out?
I'm coming early.
"
When they all came down the stairs while holding Akechi's body together, there was a squealing sound above their heads and the hole in the tatami mat was closed again.
Isn't it a very well-established mechanical mechanism?
Even if you go down to the basement, it's still not the chief's room.
After going a little further along the concrete corridor, relying on the dim light of the electric light, I was blocked by a sturdy iron door.
A man disguised as a beggar knocked on the door with a strange tap.
Then, the heavy iron door was opened from the inside, and the light of the electric light pierced the eye, and the Western-style room, which was dazzlingly decorated. A gentleman in a kimono was Twenty Faces himself.
I don't know if this is his real face, but he's a handsome man with a neatly curly hair and no beard.
"
well done.
well done.
I will never forget your work.
"
The leader is overjoyed that he has captured his archenemy, Kogoro Akechi.
There is no reason to do so.
If even Akechi was locked up like this, there wouldn't be a single scary opponent in Japan.
Poor Detective Akechi was rolled on the floor there, bound in a circle.
Akai Torazo even kicked Akechi's head over and over with his foot, thinking that just rolling it would not be enough.
"
Oh, you often have a grudge against him.
That's why it's my friend.
But stop it.
Enemies are kind, and this man is the one and only detective in Japan.
Don't be so violent, remove the rope and let him lie down on your long chair.
"
As expected, the leader with twenty faces knew how to handle captives.
So, as ordered, the subordinates removed the rope and put Detective Akechi on a chair, but perhaps the medicine hadn't cooled yet, and the detective was exhausted and had no identity.
The man disguised as a beggar gave a detailed report on why he had recruited Detective Akechi and why he had Torazo Akai on his side.
"
Well done.
Mr. Akai seems to be quite useful.
Besides, what I liked more than anything was that he had a deep grudge against Akechi.
”
Twenty Faces is overwhelmed by the joy of being captivated by the great detective.
Akai was again forced to take a solemn vow to become his disciple, and after that, the vagrant would immediately ask him about the strange and unbearable thing.
"
I was surprised by the mechanism of this house.
If this is the case, the police shouldn't be afraid.
However, I still have something to do.
Why did you see me when you just arrived at the front door?
”
"
Hahaha...that's it.
That's right.
Look here.
"
The chief pointed to something like a stove chimney hanging from a corner of the ceiling.
He was told to take a peek, so Akai went there and put his eyes on the crooked mouth of the ladder under the chimney.
Then what about this?
In the cylinder, the scenery from the entrance to the gate of this house is cutely reduced.
You can clearly see the man who was the gatekeeper standing faithfully inside the gate.
"
It's the same mechanism as periscopes used on submarines.
It's more complicated than that, though.
”
No wonder they needed an electric lamp with such strong light.
"
But what you've seen so far is less than half the mechanical work of this house.
There are tricks in it that no one knows but me.
After all, this is my real stronghold.
There are a few more hiding spots here, but they're just temporary shelters to deceive your enemies.
"
Then, was the hovel in Toyamagahara where Kobayashi was once tortured one of those hidden places?
"
I'll show it to you someday, but my art room is in the back.
"
Twenty Faces is still exhilarated and talks too much.
I could see behind his easy chair a large iron door with intricate mechanics, like the vaults of a big bank, all around it.
"
There are several rooms inside.
Hahaha... you're surprised.
This basement is much larger than the house that stands on the ground.
And in that room, the booty of my life is neatly sorted and displayed.
I'll show you later.
There is also an empty room with nothing on display yet.
A lot of national treasures are going to be put there very soon.
You must be reading in the newspaper too.
A lot of treasures in that national museum.
Hahaha…….
"
Since he had already seen his archenemy, Akechi, the Twenty-Faced Faces were as if they had acquired the works of art.
Detective Akechi didn't come home until the next morning, so Rusu's house was in an uproar.
I had the address of the woman who had commissioned the case with whom the detective had gone.
For the first time, people realized that this was the work of Twenty Faces.
The evening edition of each newspaper
"
Mr. Kogoro Akechi, a famous detective, is invited.
”
With a big headline, Akechi's photo was put in a large size, and this camellia was written as Deka Deka, and the radio also reported this in detail.
"
Alas, our great detective has fallen prey to thieves.
The museum is dangerous.
”
The ten million citizens of the city are filled with grief as if it were their own, and wherever people gather, there are only rumors about this incident, and the sky of the entire city is covered with indescribably gloomy, black clouds of anxiety. I couldn't help but feel like that.
However, it was Yoshio Kobayashi, the detective's boy assistant, who felt most sorry for the kidnapped detective in the world.
After waiting all night, even when morning comes, or after waiting in vain for another day, even when night comes, the teacher will not return.
The police say that he was kidnapped by Twenty Faces, and the newspapers and radio also report that fact. I can't help but regret it.
In addition to worrying about himself, Kobayashi had to comfort the teacher's wife.
As expected of Detective Akechi's wife, she didn't show tears, but when I saw her deliberately putting on a smile on her face, which was pale and unbearably anxious, I was taken aback and sat still. I can't.
"
Your wife is doing great.
Is it possible for a teacher to become a captive of a thief?
I'm sure the teacher has some deep tricks that we don't know about.
That's why I can come home so much.
"
Mr. Kobayashi said so and comforted Mrs. Akechi, but he was not particularly confident. It was
Mr. Kobayashi, the excellent detective assistant, is helpless this time.
There are no clues to know the secret of Twenty Faces.
The day before yesterday, a bandit's subordinate disguised himself as a picture-story show and came to find out what was going on.
Then, with a sliver of hope, I would often go upstairs and look around the main street in the hope that there might be a way to find out where the thieves lived, but I didn't even see anyone who looked like it.
On the thief's side, since he had served his purpose of kidnapping, he probably didn't need to do that again.
And just like that, the second night of anxiety was over, and it was the morning of the third day.
It was a Sunday, and just as Mrs. Akechi and the young Kobayashi had finished their lonely breakfast, a boy burst into the entrance like a bullet.
"
Excuse me.
Kobayashi-kun, are you there?
I'm Hashiba.
”
Surprised by the clear cries of the children, I went out and saw Soji Hashiba, the boy I hadn't seen in a long time, standing out of breath with his pretty face shining brightly.
It looks like you ran in a big hurry.
Readers, don't forget.
This boy is the son of the great businessman Sotaro Hashiba, who once set a trap in his garden and tortured Twenty Faces.
"
Oya, are you Souji?
Nice to meet you.
Sarah, get up.
"
Kobayashi took care of Soji, who was two years younger than himself, as if he were his younger brother, and led him to the reception room.
"
So, do you have something special to do?
”
When I asked about it, Souji said in a grown-up tone:
"
Akechi-sensei, it was a lot of work.
They still don't know where they are going.
Regarding that, I have a little consultation.
You know, ever since that incident, I've worshiped you.
And you know, I wanted to be like you.
Also, when I told everyone about your work at school, ten people who had the same idea as me gathered.
That's why we're all forming a group called the Boy Detectives Club.
Of course, I don't want it to get in the way of schoolwork or anything else.
As long as my father doesn't get lazy at school, he kindly forgives me.
Today will be Sunday.
That's why I took everyone with me to visit Kiminchi.
And everyone is saying that we, the Detective Boys, should take your advice and use our power to find Akechi-sensei's whereabouts.
"
After saying that all in one breath, Souji-kun stared at Kobayashi with cute eyes and waited for an answer.
"
Thank you.
"
Kobayashi finally managed to hold back tears and squeezed Souji's hand.
"
If Akechi-sensei heard about you, how happy he would be.
Yes, please help me with your detective team.
Let's all try to find some clues.
But you guys are different from me, so I won't let you do anything dangerous.
If something happens, I feel sorry for everyone's fathers and mothers.
But what I'm thinking of now is the least dangerous detective method.
Do you know "Kikikomi"?
It's a detective method where you go around listening to stories of various people and get clues without getting caught up in even the smallest of things.
Children are more agile than adults, and I think they will do well.
Besides, we know the face and clothes of the woman who took the teacher out the night before yesterday, and also the direction of the car, so all we have to do is head in that direction and do our current questioning. world.
It could be a store boy, an errand boy, a postman, or a child playing around there, and he would go around asking questions without hesitation.
Even if you know the direction here, the further you go, the more difficult it is to find your way.
Each time we find a way, we have to go in that direction one by one.
So, if you spend the day asking questions, you might be able to find some clues.
"
"
yeah, let's do that.
That's not true.
Then, can I call the members of the detective team into the gate?
"
"
Yes, please, let's go out together.
"
After getting permission from Mrs. Akechi, the two went out to the porch. I went back inside the gate.
When I looked at them, they were healthy and cheerful boys, about the size of upper elementary school students.
Mr. Kobayashi was introduced by Mr. Soji and greeted everyone from the porch.
Then, I gave details about the methods of detective investigation by Akechi.
Of course we all agree.
"
Good luck Kobayashi.
"
There was even a boy who was overjoyed at the fact that he had already made a feast for the leader of the ring.
"
Let's start now.
”
Then, like a boy band, all of them disappeared outside the gates of the Akechi residence.
The Detective Boys' tireless search continued on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, using their spare time from school, but they never came up with any clues.
But it's a difficult case that even thousands of adult police officers in Tokyo can't do anything about.
The lack of clues is by no means the fault of the juvenile search party's incompetence.
Besides, these gallant boys are not going to do anything again later.
Detective Akechi's whereabouts remain unknown, and the terrifying December 10th draws near day by day.
The people of the Metropolitan Police Department feel that they can't stand it anymore.
After all, the items that were threatened to be stolen were national treasures, so the Chief of the Investigation Division and Chief Nakamura, who was often involved in the case of Twenty Faces, were emaciated by worry.
However, two days before the day in question, on the 8th of December, something happened that caused yet another stir in the world.
That is to say, a letter from Twenty Faces was neatly published in the social section of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun that day.
The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun is by no means a thief's organ newspaper, but the fact that it is a letter from the person who is at the center of this turmoil cannot be ignored.
I immediately held an editorial meeting and decided to publish the full text.
It was a long sentence, but to summarize the meaning,
"
I had previously predicted that the museum would be attacked on December 10th, but I felt that it would be more manly to make a more accurate promise, so I am hereby announcing the date to the people of Tokyo. .
It is 'December 10th at 4:00 pm'.
I would like the director of the museum and the superintendent of police to be as vigilant as possible.
The more alert I am, the brighter my adventures will be.
"
Oh my God!
It was an amazing audacity to just announce the date, but in addition, they clearly announced the time.
He even gives the director of the museum and the superintendent of police a rude warning.
Needless to say, Tokyoites were surprised when they read this.
People who used to laugh at such absurdity can no longer laugh.
The director of the museum at the time was Dr. Kitakoji, a great senior in the world of history. I had a lot of meetings with the general manager.
No, that's not all.
Twenty Faces was even brought up in Cabinet meetings among Ministers of State.
Among them, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice were so worried that they invited the Superintendent General to a separate room to offer words of encouragement.
Then, in the midst of the anxiety of all the citizens of Tokyo, the days passed in vain, and finally it was December 10th.
At the National Museum, from the early morning of that day, the director of the museum, Dr. Kitakoji, three chiefs, ten secretaries, sixteen guards and errands, all went to work, guarding their respective departments. I arrived.
Of course, on the day of the event, the front gate is closed and viewing is prohibited.
From the Metropolitan Police Department, 50 police officers selected by Chief Investigator Nakamura will go on a business trip and work hard at the museum's front gate, back gate, around the fence, and at key points in the museum. .
At 3:30 p.m., with only half an hour to go, the guards were terribly ferocious.
Just then, a large vehicle from the Metropolitan Police Department arrived, and the Superintendent General appeared with the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department.
The Inspector General was so worried that he could no longer sit still.
I couldn't stand it if I wasn't watching over the museum with my own eyes.
After inspecting everyone's vigilance, the superintendents went to the director's office and met with Dr. Kitakoji.
"
I didn't expect you to go out of your way.
I'm afraid.
"
When the old doctor said hello, the director-general gave a slightly embarrassed smile.
"
No, it's a shame, but you can't sit still.
It's a real shame to have to make such a fuss for just one thief.
This is the first time since I entered the Metropolitan Police Department that I have been subjected to such a terrible disgrace.
"
"
Ahaha…….
”
The old doctor smiled weakly,
"
I am the same.
I've had insomnia for a week because of that teenage bandit.
”
"
But there's about twenty minutes left.
Oh, Mr. Kitakoji, it's a bit of a difficult feat even for a wizard to break through this serious guard and steal a lot of art in twenty minutes, isn't it?
”
"
I do not understand.
I don't know anything about wizards.
I just hope that four o'clock will pass as soon as possible.
"
said the old doctor in an offended tone.
So much so that even talking about Twenty Faces must be frustrating.
The three of us in the room just sat there and stared at the clock on the wall.
Surrounded by a stern uniform with gold trim, the Superintendent General has a sumo wrestler-like physique. The sight of the three of them sitting in their easy chairs, glancing at the hands of the clock, was rather strange and out of place than gloomy.
After more than ten minutes had passed, the chief of the detective department, who had been unable to endure silence, suddenly spoke up.
"
Ah, Akechi-kun, what on earth are you doing?
I was on friendly terms with that man, but it's strange.
Based on my experience so far, I'm not the kind of guy who would make such a mistake.
"
At those words, the superintendent twisted his fat body and looked at the faces of his subordinates.
"
You guys say Akechi Akechi, as if you were worshiping that man, but I disagree.
No matter how great he is, he's just a private detective.
how much you can do
I heard that he said he could capture Twenty Faces by himself, but that's too broad a statement.
This failure will be good medicine for him.
”
"
However, when I think about Akechi's achievements so far, I can't really say that.
I talked to Mr. Nakamura outside even now, but at a time like this, I wish that man would be there.
”
It was time for the head of the detective department's words to come to an end.
The door of the director's office opened quietly, and a person appeared.
"
Akechi is here.
”
The person smiled and spoke in a familiar voice.
"
Oh, Akechi-kun!
”
The detective chief jumped up from his chair and shouted.
It was Kogoro Akechi himself, as he always was, wearing a handsome black suit and his hair was a mess.
"
Akechi-kun, why are you...
"
"
I will talk about that later.
There are more important things to do now.
"
"
Of course, the theft of works of art must be done without prejudice.
"
"
No, it's too late.
I'm sorry.
The promised time has passed.
"
At Akechi's words, the director, the superintendent, and the head of the detective department all looked up at the electric clock on the wall.
Indeed, the minute hand has already passed twelve o'clock.
"
Oh my God, then Twenty Faces must have lied.
There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary inside the building...
”
"
Oh yes.
The promised four o'clock had passed.
After all, he couldn't help himself.
”
The detective chief shouted like a triumphant song.
"
No, the thief kept his promise.
This museum is as empty as it gets.
"
Akechi said in a funny tone.
"
Eh, what are you talking about?
I don't care if anything is stolen.
I've just been looking around the galleries with my own eyes.
And there are fifty police officers stationed around the museum.
My cops aren't blind.
”
The police chief glared at Akechi and shouted angrily.
"
However, it has been completely stolen.
As usual, Twenty Faces used magic.
If so, why don't we check it out together?
”
Akechi replied quietly.
"
Hoon, you say you've been stolen.
Alright then, let's all check it out.
Director, whether this man is telling the truth or not, let's go to the galleries.
"
I couldn't believe that Akechi was lying, so I decided to check it out.
"
that would be nice.
Come on, Kitakoji-sensei, let's go together.
"
Akechi nodded at the old curator, who had white hair and a white beard, and smiled.
So, the four of them left the director's office together and walked down the corridor toward the display area of ​​the main building. It was
"
Akechi, you must have had a dream.
There are no abnormalities anywhere.
”
As soon as we entered the display area, the Chief of Police cried out,
Just as the director said, the glass-enclosed display shelves are lined with national treasure Buddha statues, and it seems that nothing is missing.
"
Is this.
"
Akechi pointed to the display shelf of the Buddha statue and, looking meaningfully at the manager's face, called out to the guard who was standing there.
"
Please open this glass door.
”
The guard didn't know Kogoro Akechi, but he was with the museum director and the superintendent general, so he obeyed the order and used the key he was carrying to rattle open the large glass door.
Then, in the next semester, something strange happened.
Oh, Detective Akechi, did you get your mind wrong?
He went into a large display case, approached the largest carved ancient Buddha statue, and suddenly snapped off its handsome arm.
What's more, the three people were so stunned that they forgot to stop, and while their eyes were wide open, they found five Buddha statues, all of which were national treasures, on the same display shelf. One after another, in an instant, I made one piece after another irreparably damaged.
Some had their arms broken, some had their necks torn off, and some had their fingers torn off.
"
Akechi-kun, what are you doing?
Hey, no.
Yosanka.
"
Hearing the yelling from the superintendent and the head of the detective department in unison, Akechi rushed out of the display shelf and, as usual, went over to the old director's side, held his hand, and smiled. They are laughing.
"
Hey, Akechi-kun, what did you say?
There is a limit to Ranbou, isn't there?
These are all the most precious national treasures in the museum.
"
The head of the detective department, who had gone mad and raised his hands, looked as if he was about to grab Akechi.
"
Hahaha…….
Even if this is a national treasure, where are your eyes?
Please take a good look.
Please carefully examine the wound on the Buddha statue that I have just broken off.
"
Hearing Akechi's confident tone, the Chief of Detectives was taken aback as he approached the Buddha statue and looked around at its wound.
Then what do you think?
His neck had been torn off and his hands had been broken, and from the wounds he could still see a bright white edge that bore no resemblance to the dark, old-fashioned appearance of his appearance.
There is no way that such a new material would have been used in sculptures from the Nara period.
"
So, are you saying that this Buddha statue is a fake?
”
"
That's right, if only you had a little bit more of an eye for art, you would have been able to tell at a glance that it was a fake, without having to make such a wound.
They made an imitation of new wood and painted it from the outside to make it look like an old Buddha statue.
It can be done without any difficulty, as long as it is put in the hands of a craftsman who specializes in imitations.
”
Akechi casually explained.
"
Mr. Kitakoji, what the hell is going on here?
The exhibits in the National Museum are completely fake...
"
The superintendent-general of the police said as if to taunt the old director.
"
I was appalled.
It's disgusting.
”
Akechi took his hand, and the old doctor stood dazed.
Hearing the commotion, three staff rushed in.
One of them was an expert in ancient art appraisal, and was the head of that department.
"
Alas, these are all imitations.
But it's strange.
Until yesterday, the real thing was indeed here.
I must have walked into this cabinet last afternoon.
”
"
Then, what was real until yesterday suddenly turned into a fake today.
What the heck is this?
"
The general manager looked around at everyone with an expression as if he was pinched by a fox.
"
Still don't get it?
In other words, the inside of this museum has become completely empty.
"
While saying this, Akechi pointed to another display shelf on the other side.
"
What?
Then you...
”
The head of the detective department involuntarily let out a strange voice.
The first museum staffer seemed to have grasped the meaning of Akechi's words, and quickly approached the front of the shelf, pressed his face against the glass, and stared at the blackened Buddhist paintings lined up inside.
and immediately cried out.
"
Ah, this one, this one, that one, director, director, the pictures in this are all fakes.
Every single one is fake.
"
"
Please check the other shelves.
hurry, hurry.
"
Without even waiting for the chief of detectives to say something, the three staff members roared and frantically peered from display to display.
"
It's fake.
All of the remarkable works of art are imitations.
”
After that, they rolled down to the exhibition hall, but when they returned to the second floor after a while, the number of staff had increased to more than ten.
And everyone is already maddened and resentful.
"
The same is true below.
All that's left is the boring stuff.
Valuables such as valuables are completely fakes...
However, Director, I've been talking to everyone now, and I can't help but wonder.
Until yesterday, indeed, there were no imitations.
Each person in charge asserts that point with confidence.
In just one day, hundreds of works of art, large and small, were transformed into counterfeits, as if by magic.
”
The staff stomped on the ground in frustration and cried out.
"
Akechi-kun, it looks like we've been beaten for him again.
"
The superintendent looked back at the great detective with sorrow.
"
that's right.
The museum was robbed for Twenty Faces.
It's just as I said earlier.
”
Among the crowd, Akechi was the only one who didn't stand out in the slightest, and even had a smile on his lips.
Then, as if to lift the old director, who seemed to have lost the strength to stand from the blow, he firmly grasped his hand.
"
But we don't know why.
It is not possible for human beings to replace such works of art with counterfeits in a single day.
Well, as for the counterfeit, if you can pretend to be an art student and come to see it and draw a picture, it's possible to imitate it, but the problem is how you replaced it.
I don't understand it at all.
"
The museum staff nodded their heads as if they had run into a difficult math problem.
"
Until yesterday evening, it was true, they were all real.
”
When the director asked, the staff seemed confident,
"
It is no longer wrong.
"
and answer with a straight mouth.
"
Then, perhaps around midnight last night, someone from the Twenty Faces gang might have sneaked in here for some reason.
"
"
No, you shouldn't be able to do that.
A large number of police officers stayed up all night watching over the front gate, the back gate, and around the fence.
Even in the museum, the director and three night watchmen were busy all night long.
How could you bring in and take out that many works of art while passing through such a difficult barrier?
This is something that cannot be done by human effort.
"
The staff was just fine.
"
I don't know, it's really strange...
But the guy with twenty faces wasn't as manly as I said.
If you replace it with a counterfeit in advance and then say that it has been stolen, a notice of 4:00 pm on the 10th is completely meaningless.
"
The head of the detective department couldn't help but say something like that to his frustration.
"
However, it was not meaningless.
"
Akechi Kogoro said it as if he were defending Twenty Faces.
He and the old curator, Dr. Kitakoji, have been holding hands from the very beginning, as if they were good friends.
"
Huh, wasn't that pointless?
What does that mean?
"
The Superintendent General looked at the great detective with a curious look and asked.
"
Please take a look at that.
”
Akechi then approached the window and pointed to the open space behind the museum.
"
That is the secret I had to wait until about the tenth of December.
”
On that vacant lot, there used to be an old Japanese-style staff's night duty room that had been used since the museum was founded, but it became useless, and a few days ago, the house was demolished, and the demolition was almost over. Old lumber and straw roofs were piled up here and there.
"
You demolished the old house.
But what does that have to do with the case of Twenty Faces?
”
The detective chief looked at Akechi in surprise.
"
You'll soon understand what kind of relationship there is...
Could someone please tell Inspector Nakamura inside to bring the policeman who was guarding the back gate around noon today and hurry over here?
"
At Akechi's urging, one of the museum staff hurried downstairs for some unknown reason, but soon returned with Chief Investigator Nakamura and a policeman.
"
Are you the one who was at the back gate around noon?
”
When Akechi immediately asked, since the policeman was in front of the superintendent, he suddenly stood up straight and stood still.
"
that's right.
"
I answered.
"
Then, between noon and about one o'clock today, you saw a truck leave the back gate.
"
"
Ah, aren't you asking about the old timber truck from the demolished house?
"
"
that's right.
”
"
If so, it certainly passed.
"
The police looked as if they were asking what had happened to the old lumber.
"
Do you understand now?
This is the thief's magic seed.
On the surface it looked like it was full of old lumber, but in fact it was full of stolen art.
"
Akechi looked around at everyone and made an astonishing discovery.
"
So, are you saying that among the laborers who were taken down were thieves' minions?
”
Chief Nakamura blinked his eyes and asked again.
"
that's right.
It is possible that all the laborers were underlings of thieves.
Twenty Faces had made all the necessary preparations early on and had been waiting for this golden opportunity.
I believe the demolition of houses began on December 5th.
The start date should have been known to those involved before March or April.
If so, around the 10th would be the day when old lumber would be brought out.
The date of December 10th in the notice was calculated from such a place.
Also, four o'clock in the afternoon meant that the real works of art had been safely transported to the thieves' den, and it was safe to say that the counterfeits had already been discovered.
"
Oh, what a well-thought-out plan!
Twenty-faced sorcery is always prepared with tricks that the general public would never think of.
"
But Akechi-kun, even if you were able to get it out that way, you still can't figure out how the thief entered the display room, and why he suddenly replaced the real with the fake.
”
The Chief of the Criminal Investigation Division makes it difficult to believe Akechi's words.
"
I did the replacement late last night.
"
Akechi continued speaking in a tone as if he knew everything.
"
Workers disguised as thieves' subordinates brought in pieces of counterfeit art each day they came here to work.
If you roll up the picture thinly, and take apart the Buddha statue and wrap it up separately in the hands, feet, neck, and torso, and bring it along with the carpenter's tools, you won't have to worry about being misled.
Everyone is so wary of things being stolen that they don't pay attention to what they bring in.
And all the counterfeits were hidden in piles of old timber, waiting for the night of last night.
"
"
But who put it in the display room?
The laborers all go home in the evening, don't they?
Even if some of them were to remain secretly in the premises, how could they enter the display room?
At night, the entrance is completely closed.
Inside the hall, the director and three night watchers were watching without sleeping.
It would be quite impossible to replace so many items without them knowing.
"
One of the curators asked a very valid question.
"
It also had a very daring means at its disposal.
The three night watchmen from last night must have gone home this morning.
Please call one of the three homes to see if the husband has returned.
”
Akechi said something strange again.
None of the three night watchmen had a telephone, but they each called out to a nearby merchant's house, and they were able to get through. It turns out that he hasn't been home since.
In the homes of the night watchmen, it was said that they were relieved that they would be stopped today because of such an incident.
"
Isn't it a little strange that it's been eight or nine hours since the three of them left the museum and they still haven't come home together?
I don't think I'm playing around because I'm tired from staying up all night last night.
Do you understand why the three did not return?
"
Akechi glanced at everyone's faces again and continued.
"
Nothing else.
The three were kidnapped for the sake of the Twenty Faces gang.
"
"
Huh, were you invited?
When is that?
"
The staff screamed.
"
Yesterday evening, the three of us left home to work the night shift.
”
"
Eh, eh, last night?
Well then, the three of you who were here last night...
”
"
He was a subordinate of Twenty Faces.
The real night watchmen were forced into the thieves' dens, and instead, the thieves' subordinates took charge of night watch at the museum.
What a nonsense.
The thieves were on guard duty, so replacing the counterfeit works of art was a no-brainer.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the trick of Twenty Faces.
With a little brain power, they can easily do things that are impossible for humans to do.
"
Detective Akechi praised Twenty Faces for his intelligence, and gripped the wrist of Dr. Kitakoji, who had been holding his hand the whole time, until it hurt.
"
Hmm, was that the thief's minion?
I was careless.
I was careless.
"
The old doctor shook his white beard and groaned.
His eyes are bulging, his face is straight, and he has a terrifying look of wrath.
But how could the old doctor not see through the three imposters?
It is unthinkable that the three underlings had disguised themselves so skillfully that even the director didn't recognize them.
Isn't it a bit strange that someone who could be Dr. Kitakoji could be deceived so easily?
"
But Akechi.
”
The Superintendent General asked Detective Akechi as if waiting for the end of the explanation.
"
You explained the order of the art robbery in detail, as if you yourself had twenty faces, but I wonder if it's all your imagination.
Or maybe it's some kind of real world.
”
"
Of course, it is not imaginary.
With my own ears, I learned all the secrets from Twenty Faces' subordinates.
I just heard about it.
”
"
What?
Did you meet Twenty Faces' subordinates?
Where on earth?
Why?
"
Even the superintendent-general of the police was suddenly taken aback.
"
I met him at the Hidden Faces of Twenty Faces.
Your Excellency, you know that I was kidnapped for Twenty Faces.
That's what I thought in my family and in the world, and that's what the newspapers were saying.
But, to tell you the truth, it was just a ruse on my part.
I wasn't tempted.
On the contrary, I became an ally of the thieves and even helped a certain person to lure me.
Last year, I was visited one day by a mysterious applicant for apprenticeship.
I was very surprised when I saw the man.
I wondered if a big mirror had stood in front of me.
The reason for this is that the applicant for apprenticeship was so similar to me in everything from the stature, to the facial features, to the way the hair was curly on the head.
In other words, he wants me to take him as my body double, as a substitute for me in case something happens.
Without telling anyone, I called him out and let him live somewhere else, and this time it worked.
I went out that day, went to the man's hideout, completely changed his clothes, sent the man who pretended to be me back to my office first, and after a while, I myself was a vagrant. Disguising himself as Torazo Akai, he visited the Akechi office and had a little wrestle with his double on the porch.
When the bandit's subordinates saw this, they completely trusted me.
And if Akechi had such a grudge against him, he recommended that he become a subordinate of Twenty Faces.
So, after helping me lure my double, I was finally able to enter the thieves' den.
However, Twenty-Faced Guy was very impatient, and from the day I joined the group, he used me only for work in the house and never let me go out.
Of course, they didn't give me the slightest idea how to steal the museum's works of art.
And finally, today has come.
I made up my mind and waited for the afternoon to come.
Then, at about two o'clock in the afternoon, the entrance to the thief's hidden cellar opened, and a number of men in laborer's attire rushed in, with precious works of art in their hands.
It's a stolen item from a museum.
While I was on guard duty in the cellar, I prepared sake and fish.
Then I offered a toast to all of my subordinates who had returned and those who had remained with me.
So, the subordinates, overwhelmed by the joy of the success of the big project, began drinking, but after about 30 minutes, one fell down, two fell down, and finally, there was nothing left to do. I lost it and collapsed.
Why?
You know, don't you?
I took the anesthetic from the thief's medicine room and mixed it into the liquor beforehand.
After that, I slipped out by myself, rushed to the nearby police station, explained the situation, and asked for the arrest of Twenty Faces' subordinates and the safekeeping of all the stolen goods hidden in the basement.
Please be happy.
The stolen items were completely recovered.
The works of art in the National Museum, the treasures of that nasty old man Kusakabe's art castle, and all the other items that Twenty Faces has stolen so far will be returned to their original owners. .
"
The people listened to Akechi's long explanation in a drunken fascination.
Oh, the detective lived up to its name.
As he proclaimed before the people, he single-handedly tracked down the thieves' den, recovered all the stolen goods, and captured many wicked people.
"
Akechi, you did well.
well done.
It seems I've been a little mistaken about you until now.
Thank you very much.
"
The superintendent-general suddenly approached the great detective and grabbed his left hand.
Why did you grab your left hand?
It was because Akechi's right hand was blocked.
His right hand was still tightly clenched with the hand of the old museum director.
Myo, isn't it?
Why is Akechi so obsessed with the old doctor?
"
So, did Twenty Faces drink the anesthetic too?
You've always talked about your subordinates, and never mentioned the name of Twenty Faces.
"
Chief Investigator Nakamura suddenly noticed it and asked worriedly.
"
No, Twenty Faces never returned to the basement.
But I always get it right.
”
Akechi smiled and replied with that charming smile.
"
where are you
Where did you get it?
"
Inspector Nakamura asked hastily.
The other people, including the superintendent, are also staring at the detective's face, waiting for a reply.
"
I got it here.
"
Akechi calmly answered.
"
here?
So where are you now?
”
"
here i am.
”
Ah, what is Akechi trying to say?
"
I'm talking about Twenty Faces.
"
The police officer asked back with a questioning look on his face.
"
I'm talking about Twenty Faces too.
”
Akechi replied with a moan.
"
If you're like a riddle, don't do it.
There are only people here that we know.
Or are you saying that Twenty Faces is hidden in this room?
"
"
Well, yes.
Let's take a look at one thing...
I'm sorry to bother you so often, but I have four guests waiting in the drawing-room downstairs.
”
Akechi says something unexpected again.
One of the staff hurried downstairs.
Before long, there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs, and four guests appeared before them.
Seeing this, the members of the troupe were so surprised,
"
Oh.
"
I couldn't help but scream.
First, look at the old gentleman with gray hair and white beard who stands in front of the four.
Wasn't it unmistakably Dr. Kitakoji?
The following three people are all museum staff, and their whereabouts have been unknown since yesterday evening.
"
These people I have rescued from the Hidden Faces of Twenty Faces.
”
Akechi explained.
But what is this?
Didn't Dr. Kitakoji, the director of the museum, become two?
One was Dr. Kitakoji, who was just coming up from downstairs, and the other was Dr. Kitakoji, who had been holding Akechi's hand since the beginning.
The two old doctors, who were exactly the same in clothes and facial features, looked at each other and glared at each other.
"
Ladies and gentlemen, do you understand how much Twenty Faces is a master of disguise?
"
Detective Akechi cried out, suddenly twisted the old man's hand, which he had been kindly holding until now, and put it on the floor. I took it.
Beneath it appeared black hair and a youthful smooth face.
Needless to say, this was the true Twenty Faces person.
"
Hahaha... Twenty Faces, thank you for your hard work.
You must have been in a lot of pain from the very beginning.
I had to sit back and keep a straight face as my secrets unfolded in front of my eyes.
Even if I try to run away, I can't run away in front of this crowd.
No, more than that, my hands were holding onto your wrists instead of the handcuffs.
Was your wrist numb?
Well, come on, I may have bullied you a little too much.
”
Akechi looked down at Twenty Faces, who was drooping his head in silence, and sarcastically comforted him.
Even so, why didn't the Twenty Faces disguised as the director run away sooner?
By the end of the night, I had achieved my goal, so if I had just pulled out with the help of the three double staff members, I would not have had to face such an embarrassing experience.
But, dear readers, that is the Twenty Faces.
The fact that he didn't even try to run away and remained boldly in the room was a very characteristic way of Twenty Faces.
He wanted to see the police surprised by the counterfeit artwork.
If Akechi hadn't appeared, the curator himself must have pretended to have discovered the theft at exactly 4 p.m.
Isn't this an adventure worthy of Twenty Faces?
But the adventure passed, and at last he made an irreparable mistake.
Now, Detective Akechi turned to face the Superintendent General,
"
Your Excellency, I will hand over the Phantom Thief with Twenty Faces.
"
I said politely and bowed.
Everyone was taken aback by the unexpected scene, forgetting to praise the detective's splendid hands, and stood motionless. Then, as soon as he proceeded to Tikatsuka's side and pulled out a ready-made arresting rope, he immediately caught the thief behind his back with a brilliant hand.
"
Akechi, thank you.
Thanks to you, I was able to really put a rope on the enviable Twenty Faces this time.
I've never been so happy.
"
Chief Nakamura had tears of gratitude in his eyes.
"
Well then, I'll take this guy and make the policemen out there happy...
Come on, Twenty Faces, stand up.
”
The clerk called the phantom thief down and bowed to everyone, and he and the policeman who had been standing beside him gleefully descended the stairs.
A dozen or so police officers were stationed at the front gate of the museum.
When I saw the chief of staff appearing at the front entrance of the building, with the twenty-faced leash removed, I rushed over to his side.
"
Good luck to you guys.
Thanks to Akechi-kun's efforts, we finally caught this guy.
This is the president of Twenty Faces.
"
When the chief of staff made a proud report, there was a thud among the police officers.
Twenty Faces was miserable.
As expected, the phantom thief had finally given up on his luck, and he didn't have the strength to show his usual brazen smile.
After that, everyone formed a line in the middle of the bandit and left the front gate.
Outside the gate is a grove of trees like a forest in a park.
Two police cars can be seen beyond the trees.
"
Hey, someone get one of those cars over here.
"
At the chief's order, a policeman rushed out with a baton.
Everyone's gaze follows after that and is poured into Haruka's car.
The police were completely relieved by the strange appearance of the bandits.
Chief Nakamura was also preoccupied with cars.
Strangely enough, people's eyes turned away from the thieves.
It was a perfect opportunity for thieves.
Gritting his teeth and putting all his strength into it, the Twenty-Faced Face shook off Chief Nakamura's grip.
"
Umm, wait.
"
By the time the foreman screamed back to his feet, the bandit was already ten meters away and running like an arrow.
A strange figure with its hands tied behind its back flew into the woods looking like it was about to roll over at any moment.
At the entrance to the forest, about ten elementary school students, who seemed to be returning from a walk, stopped and watched.
As Twenty Faces ran, he thought that there were some troublesome boys, but he had to go through them to escape into the woods.
Oh, my dear children, when they see my terrifying face, they will run away in fear.
If he doesn't run away, I'll kick him through.
The thief made up his mind and rushed at the crowd of elementary school students.
However, Twenty Faces was completely out of line, and instead of running away, the elementary school students burst out screaming and jumped at the thief.
Readers, you already know.
These elementary school students were the Detective Boys, led by Yoshio Kobayashi.
The boys had been wandering around the museum for a long time, waiting to help in some way.
First, Kobayashi, the first boy, jumped at Twenty Faces like a bullet.
Next, Soji Hashiba, who was next, who was next, in a blink of an eye, folded himself over the bandit and immediately rolled the opponent who had crippled hands over there.
Twenty Faces, as expected, was finally lucky.
"
Oh thank you, you guys are brave.
"
Chief Nakamura thanked the boys who had rushed over, joined forces with the police officers under him, and took them to the police car that had just arrived. did.
At that moment, a gentleman in a black suit appeared from inside the gate.
Detective Akechi, who learned of the turmoil and set off.
As soon as Kobayashi saw the clumsy appearance of his teacher, he let out a cry of surprise and ran to his side.
"
Oh, Mr. Kobayashi.
"
Detective Akechi instinctively called out the boy's name, spread out his hands, and embraced Kobayashi, who was running towards him.
It was a beautiful, glorious sight.
Together, this enviably close teacher and student finally achieved their goal of arresting the phantom thief.
And they rejoice in each other's efforts and appreciate each other's hardships.
The police officers standing in a row were also struck by this beautiful sight, and they were looking at the two of them with a smile, but with a sense of sympathy.
The 10 elementary school boys of the Detective Boys couldn't stand it anymore.
Unexpectedly, everyone's hands rose high into the sky without anyone taking the lead.
And they all cried out over and over again, all in one sweet voice.
"
Akechi-sensei, good luck.
"
"
Commander Kobayashi, good luck.
